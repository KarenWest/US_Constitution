Welcome back.
We've been talking about the role of
political parties in our
constitutional system, both in the, the
reflection of the role of
parties in the written constitution, and
the reality of parties in
the unwritten constitution of the reality
and how the system actual operates.
Consider for example independent agencies.
I mentioned those, I've mentioned those in
eariler lectures.
And one of the features of these
independent agencies is that presidents
typically cannot fire officials at will,
but only for a good cause.
Another typical feature of these
independent agencies is
that they are headed up by a commission a
multi, aboard, a multi-member body, a
hydra at
the top, rather one single person like the
Secretary
of the Interior, or the Secretary of
Defense, or the Secretary of Commerce.
The cabinet officers are removable at will
by the
President and each cabinet department is
headed by one person.
These independent agencies are headed up
by commissions or boards,
and they're not removable at will, but
only for cause.
Those are two basic distinctions between
so-called independent agencies and cabinet
departments.
Here's a third.
By law, by statutes, statutes agreed to by
basically both
parties for a very long period of time
and, and,
and both, and all the branches of
government many of
these independent agencies have formal,
official, legal rules about party
affiliation.
And these agencies are supposed to be
balanced along partisan lines.
For example, the Federal Election
Commission
which regulates, federal elections has six
members, and by law
no party may have more than three of those
six members.
There are a bunch of other commissions
that have five, or seven members,
and by statute no one party can have more
than the barest of majorities.
Whether some of these independent
agencies, the United States Sentencing
Commission,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, the Equal
Opportunity
Employment Commission, the Commodity
Futures Trading
Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, and, and,
and, and on and on So, so when we look at
independent agencies we see
the role of parties formally acknowledged
in the basic statutory structure.
When we look at the organization of
congress itself, we
see all sorts of very explicit rules about
how many
staff members the majority party will have
on each committee and the minority party.
And how the how many seats on each a
committee, the majority party's entitled
to, and the minority party.
and, indeed the two-party system is
built-in not just to these rules, but into
the informal folk ways of the place,
it's built into the very architecture of
congress.
With people in one party sitting on one
side of a proverbial aisle, and
people in the other party sitting in the
on the other side of the aisle.
So sort of built into, the very structure,
the architecture, of
congress.
Is basically a presupposition that they
will be two parties, a
majority party and the minority party, and
that presupposition, as I said,
is also built into all sorts of rules of,
of procedure
for the committees and, and for voting
rules, all sorts of stuff.
Now
and by the way, we see similar things in
the
state, in, in state legislatures, and
indeed the same two parties.
It's a two-party system basically in
states as well as the federal government.
So, how did, how does that maintain
itself?
because this seems a very stable, regular
feature of the system.
The parties might morph, might evolve,
the democrat party used to be a southern
party now the republican parties become a
southern party.
The parties kind of, you know switched
places, the guy that sort of you know
looks most like Lincoln today, is Barack
Obama
the democrat the tall skinny guy, from
Illinois.
And a lot of the members of the so-called
party of Lincoln today seem to
have, you know, affection for secession,
and
the confederate flag and all of that
stuff.
So the parties can
switch positions over time, they can
morph, but
we've had still the same two parties in
place.
Republicans and Democrats, ever since the
1850s, and that's,
an interesting feature of our system, a
kind of
fixed feature of our system, an entrenched
feature of
our system and the question is how that
comes about.
and, and how it's maintained and and that
there's we're talking a lot about law, and
we can, and we've been talking about
formal statutes
and constitutions, and, but political
scientists also talk about laws.
Economists talk about laws, which are
merely
empirical regularities that are useful in
making predictions.
The law of supply and demand.
Well that's not you know a law exactly
like the Sherman
Antitrust Law or the Smoot Hawley Tariff
or the Voting Rights Act.
It's,
it's an empirical regularity that when
price goes up, you know
fewer people demand stuff in general and
more people supply it.
And so the law supply and demand are,
are certain empirical regularities that we
tend to observe.
Political scientists have observed
political regularities.
One of the more important regularities
recognized by political scientist, is a
law
called Duverger's laws.
Named for a political science, scientist
Maurice Duverjay, and and it basically
says it's a prediction about how
many parties in any given system we are
likely to see in long-term equilibrium.
And the long-term can be quite long but,
but one version
of Duverger's law says the following: That
if you have n number
of seats simultaneously up for grabs, you
can in long-term equilibrium probably
have no more than n plus 1 viable parties.
It's a musical chairs game.
There's one less chair than there are
number of
people sort of playing to, to sit in that
chair.
So if you have three seats simultaneously
up for grabs, you could
have four parties all vying for the three
seats and, maybe two
parties that are going to get pretty,
pretty clearly
going to get a seat and, and, that third
seat
is going to be fought over by the, the,
the two lesser parties or something like
that, so.
This means if you have one seat up for
grabs,
in long-term equilibrium you're going to
have two parties vying for it.
Each party, in effect, trying to capture
that middle voter the, the,
the median voter, the person in the center
of the political spectrum.
So when you have one governor up for
grabs,
you're going to have two, gubernatorial
parties in long term equilibrium.
If you have one senator who's voted on at
any given point
in time, and we almost never have two
senators simultaneously up for election.
We might in some special election if
there's been a
death or resignation, but ordinarily the
senate races are staggered.
So that in any given year, either no
senator is up for election or only
one at a time.
because the other one is elected on a
different schedule so one senator
at a time, one governor at a time, one
president at a time.
And because of a statute passed in the
1840s, congressional districts are single
member districts, if Pennsylvania has you
know 14 representatives
they actually have to have 14 separate
districts.
They can't just have one election and
elect all
14 of them at large, or something like
that.
Single member districts have been required
by a congressional statute since 1842.
And once that statute is in place, it
basically helps stabilize a two-party
system because with only one house seat up
for grabs, and within any district at any
time, you're going to have two parties in
long term equilibrium vying for that one
seat.
That's Duverger's Law.
And we have the same two parties across
the country, because of
certain electoral economies of scale, a
ticket system in which you basically,
you vote for a slate, and you vote for
governor, and president,
and senator, and representative, and state
lawmaker all at the same time.
Many states have single-member
districts, not all of them do, but many
states
have single-member districts for their
state legislatures as well.
And here's what Duverger's law basically
suggests.
That once you have, at least once you have
a two-party
system in place, it's going to be pretty
stable and, and self
enforcing, here's the basic logic.
You've got one office up for grabs, and if
you don't vote for
one of the two major parties, your vote is
probably a wasted vote.
In the past the only people who've wanted
to come from those two parties.
So its unlikely that any new comer is
going to the threshold is set very high
and
two people running, you basically need a
majority or a
least a plurality to win, thats a very
high threshold.
If some third party comes in they're going
to
have to beat the other two established
parties at
the beginning from the get go, that's a
hard
thing to do, and here's the kick, the
kicker.
Even if you prefer that newcomer, if you
vote for that newcomer, you
may be increasing the odds that the, of
the two major political parties,
the person who you like least will win.
So, for example let's use the cast of
characters from the 2000 election.
You like Ralph Nader, because you're
ultra-liberal, you like
him better than Gore, and you really don't
like Bush.
Well if you vote for your first choice,
Ralph Nader,
you may be increasing the chances that
actually, you know, Bush
will beat Gore, because you could have
voted for Gore
and helped Gore, but instead you, in
effect, wasted your vote.
You voted for someone who wasn't going to
win at all, and that increases the
odds that Bush is going to win, and
he's your least favorite, or you're a
conservative.
You actually like Pat Buchanan best.
Bush second, Gore least of all, but if you
vote for Pat Buchanan, you're
increasing the likelihood that Gore is
going to
beat your guy, your your second choice,
Bush.
Bush isn't your first choice Buchanan is,
but a vote for Buchanan helps Gore,
it's a wasted vote.
And even if you don't think that way, many
other voters might think that way, and if
you
are not aware that they're going to, think
that
way, again, you're at risk of, of wasting
your vote.
so, in long term equilibrium, once there
two parties in place, in a single
member district system, which we've had in
place since the 1840s it's self
stabilizing.
The parties in place are unlikely to
change
that single member district rule, and with
that
single member district rule in place, plus
the
constitutional reality that we have one
president, and
one senator up for grabs any particular
time.
And the state constitutional reality that
we have
one governor up for grabs at any one time.
We basically have the political science
conditions
that exist for basically an entrenched
two-party system.
The two parties are the ones who are
controlling
the how they, they have a duopoly over the
system.
In the House, in the Senate, they are the
two major presidential parties.
They also are the two parties in operation
in
every state, for the governorship, and for
state legislature,
for the state house, for the state senate,
and
once that duopoly has kind of emerged,
it's going to
take, and been solidified simply by a
statute, single
member district, it's going to be hard to
dislodge it.
So I'm not saying that it would be
unconstitutional to change this system.
We could have a multi-party system in the
House and the Senate.
I'm simply saying, it's not this
unconstitutional and
some literal textual sense it's simply
unlikely to happen.
Because a single member district system is
constitutionally permissible.
It's one option, it, it, it's within the,
the
range of things that Congress is allowed
to, to choose.
Congress has power to determine the
time, place, and manner of congressional
elections.
They've done so in a way that basically
entrenches a two-party system, and that
two-party system
is unlikely to basically collapse unless
you have
some massive external event that shakes
everything up.
The equivalent of the
kind of massive asteroid that hits the
earth and wipes out the dinosaurs.
And so, that, that's what Duverger's law
predicts, and at least in America the
prediction seems quite robust So we
come now to the end of, of this lecture,
the basic thought is that
that the party system is pretty much
interwoven,
tightly interwoven with the Turisk text.
It's, it's, it's a basic
feature of our constitutional system and I
always
end with a discussion of, of, of the
illustration.
This is an artist depiction of
the drafting of The Declaration of
Independence.
And what we see are people working
together, people of different but
Thomas Jefferson is at one side of the
table, and
John Adams is at the other side of the
table.
Because of course we don't know how they
sat in, in that room.
The artist is taking perhaps a little
liberty, sort of reminding you
that these two people who were very close
allies in the American Revolution.
They were in the same party at that time
so to speak, the Patriot
party against the Loyalists, the Tories,
those who are partisans of George the III.
They're in the same party at the beginning
the American Revolution is launched by the
Patriots but
eventually, there's going to be a split,
because, This one
party system that, that emerges early on,
the, the,
the Loyalists and the Tories are basically
repudiated,
so it's only the Patriots that are in
charge,
led by George Washington, who's not in
here in
the picture, he's off fighting in, in, in
Massachusetts.
But the
Patriots led by George Washington and Ben
Franklin right here who's kind of in
the middle trying to, sort of maintain the
peace and, and Jefferson and Adams.
This one-party system that emerges after
the revolution is going to break into two.
Two natural parties one a southern party,
one a northern party
competing for middle America Ohio today
back
in those days, New York was the swing
state.
And and so this picture is reminding us
that we're all Americans.
When he becomes president, he says we are
all Republicans, we are all Federalists.
They're working together, but they do have
different perspectives, ours is a
two-party system.
We're all Americans, but we're also
typically Republicans and
Democrats, respectively.
As Ben Franklin reminds us, Independence
are important too.
Okay still more to do so stay tuned.
