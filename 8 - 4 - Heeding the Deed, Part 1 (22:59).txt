Welcome back.
We're talking about America's unwritten
constitution,
and we're exploring the various tools and
techniques by which faithful
constitutional interpreters
go beyond literalism in order to
ultimately
be faithful to and redeem the project of
the constitution, which does revolve
around a written text, but requires us
sometimes to go beyond just a literal
words of that text.
We've been talking about one technique of
going beyond the literal words
by reading the constitution as a whole,
but we were still reading,
there was still a, a, a technique of, of,
literary interpretation focused
on words, but focusing on the words of the
document as a whole.
That's not the only way America's written,
unwritten constitution works.
And in this lecture and
the next one I'm going to tell you about a
different tool, a different technique.
A technique that I call heeding the deed;
America's inactive Constitiion.
I say look away from the text.
We've been focusing on the text, albeit as
a whole in our
previous lectures but, but look away from
the text for a minute.
Think about the Constitution instead as a
deed, a doing,
an enactment, an ordainment, a
constituting.
Lets look at how the Constitution, in
fact, came to be, how it was ordained, how
it was established, the processes by which
that actual historical event occurred.
And let's also look at how later
generations of Americans have
in fact amended the thing, not what they
said when they,
what texts they adopted when they ordained
and amended, but it's what
they actually did in the process of
ordaining and the process of amending.
And the thought is that certain things are
deeply Constitutional, certain principles.
They're, they are baked into the
constitutional cake, so to speak, because
they are part of the very process that
gave us, historically, the constitution.
I'll give you an example.
We talked about freedom of speech and
freedom
of speech is a preeminent American right
and, and
one way of seeing that is seeing all the
ways in, in which you can derive it.
Yes, you can point to the words of the
First Amendment, free speech.
But by the way, if, if that was the only
protection,
then that would mean the first Congress
before 1791 was permitted
to censor speech.
And I don't think that's so, because I
think freedom of
speech is about more than the words of the
First Amendment.
Even before the First Amendment, I think,
freedom of speech was a constitutional
principle.
I gave you one set of reasons for thinking
that was true in my previous
lectures when I said look at the entire
structure of the Constitution as a whole.
It's about popular sovereignty.
In order to be
sovereign, the people have to talk with
each other, just like in England.
Parliament is a sovereign.
Parliament members have to speak amongst
themselves.
Now it's possible that the exact form of
free speech that American citizens have
is a little different than what members
of parliament have, what members of
congress have.
Maybe they have a slightly more absolutist
version
of free speech within Congress than
outside of Congress.
Nevertheless, there has to be a very broad
ability of
Americans to express themselves
politically
their, their political opinions in
order to be sovereign, in order to be
masters over
their servants; government officials who
work for them, not vice-versa.
That was a structural argument, trying to
make
sense of the document as a whole, trying
to also say the whole thing presupposes
fair
elections and you can't have fair
elections if the
incumbents can rig the game so that
challengers can't
criticize the incumbents, but the
incumbents can criticize the challengers.
That's that's a violation of the deep
principles of the structure of the
document.
Now, I am going to give you a different
reason, not focused on the words of
the constitution as a whole, but telling
you
the story about how the constitution
actually came about.
And, you know, in short, it comes about
through an epic
act of free series of acts really of free
speech.
The document comes to life in a land awash
with speech on a continent teaming with
free speech in the
year that changed everything: the hinge of
human history,
1787-88, that year when the constitution
was put before
the American people for their
consideration and for
them to ordain and establish it, or not.
It's not just that we the people voted on
the
thing, which we did do, state after state
after state.
We said yes, you know, we ordain and
establish this thing.
It's not just that they vote on it,
but they deliberated about it, they talked
about it.
In these special conventions and outside
the conventions, in taverns, in
neighborhoods,
on street corners and, and, in a whole
year up and down the continent
ordinary farmers are basically reading the
same proposed constitution
and, and discussing it with their, with
their friends and neighbors,
and in, in a wide variety of situations
and no one is censored.
No one is silenced.
No one
is, no one, no one is, is, no one dies,
actually for this very
vigorous, sharp-elbowed free speech,
people are nasty to each other.
Some of them are pro-George Washington and
the constitution.
Others are anti-George Washington and the
constitution.
You know people are are hanged in effigy,
but they're not hanged in person.
Free speech, yes amazingly
so, but but not violence, not censorship.
Just think about how, how stunning that
is.
Think about our world today; Egypt or
Syria, or really anywhere.
I, an entire, think about the French
Revolution
and how it, it ends up in a bloodbath.
And we have a year in which We the People
don't just vote on the thing, we actually
talk about it.
And we, and people criticize
slavery, they criticize existing
government, institutions, and practices.
And others defend the existing government
institutions and practices
this is going to, this is not always
going to prevail.
Later on the South will try to shut down
criticism of slavery.
As we talked about in previous lectures
several Southern states including North
Carolina, made it
a capital offense, a death penalty offense
to
criticize slavery, to agitate slaves, to
make them
dissatisfied with their conditions.
And that's because the 3 5ths Clause ends
up
corrupting the whole system and creating
an increasingly slavocratic system.
But back in that year that changed
everything, 1787-88,
there was epic free speech about the
Constitution, and everywhere.
And my claim is, that's baked into the
constitutional cake.
That's part of the Constitution even
before the First Amendment comes along,
because it's
part of how the Constitution in fact was
born.
And very different even than the Articles
of
Conf, I mean, excuse me, the Declaration
of Independence.
Let's recall that not only was that
declaration not put to a
vote, you know, up and down the continent
there also really wasn't the kind of,
tolerance and, and free speech that, that
fully prevailed in 1776.
If you were opposed to the Declaration of
Independence,
here are your choices: leave, you kn, or
shut up.
No one, who opposes independence fiercely
ever goes on to a
position of, of public, of a, of a of a
real importance in America.
I think there's, you know, one person,
Philip Barton Keyes, related to
Francis Scott Key, who becomes a
congressman or something, even though he,
was a loyalist, was was a backer of King
George
the Third and not George Washington in the
American Revolution.
But basically almost no one who opposes
the American Revolution
goes on to any important position of
authority in America.
In effect, they're voted off the island,
they're
ostracized, informally and a lot of them
do leave.
Can you compare that to the year that
generated the constitution, in which
people who vigorously
opposed it go on to become presidents of
the United States, James Monroe
and vice presidents, Eldridge Gary, George
Clinton,
justices on the Supreme Court, Samuel
Chase.
The people who oppose the constitution,
the anti-federalists, help bring
to life a, a, help birth the Bill of
Rights.
So, so, we have this epic conversation
between and, and contestation debate,
really between anti-federalists
and, and, and, and, and, and federalists
and it results in a Bill of
Rights which says the freedom of speech,
as if the freedom of speech already
exists.
The freedom of speech, Congress shall make
no law abridging
the freedom of speech, as if freedom of
speech already exists.
And it does.
It existed on the ground in the America
constitutional, process.
That year that changed everything, even
before the
Bill of Rights comes along which is 1791.
And, note the Bill of Rights again and
again and again uses the phrase the
people.
I mentioned the peoples' right to assemble
in the first amendment and
the right of the people to keep and bear
arms in the second.
The, the people also, that phrase reoccurs
not just in the first and the
second, but the fourth, the ninth, the
tenth amendments because it's coming from
the people.
In this, we the people, gratifying
conversation up and down
a continent, free speech is baked into the
constitutional [INAUDIBLE].
Now what kind of argument
is that?
Well, it's basically a historical
argument.
But many, it's a kind of argument
of original intent of sorts, original
understanding.
But many historical arguments are focused
on
a particular word or clause of the
Constitution.
Oh, they, at the time of the Constitution,
people said this clause would mean this or
that.
But you can all say well how many people
heard
the conversation that this clause would
mean this or that?
You know, five people, 10 people, 100, you
know, 1,000 people?
But, the Constitution is all up and down
the continent.
How many people really heard that
conversation?
So, this kind of historical argument is a
little different.
It's, it's not organized around a little
clause.
It's more like a structural argument.
Say, the Constitution as a whole was,
because it was ratified as a whole.
It's not ratified clause by clause.
That's why it's a mistake to, to interpret
it merely clause by clause.
It's ratified as a whole.
That's John Marshall's ingenious idea in
McColloch.
To ratify it as a whole, it's to be
understood as a whole and I say, the pro,
the
historical process that as a whole
generated the constitution is
really interesting and it's a process of
epic free speech.
So it's an historical argument of sorts.
It's like a structural argument and it's
holistic and not clause bound.
If you insisted it must be a textual
argument because
only textual arguments are permissible, I
could probably turn it,
translate it into textual argument because
I think the unwritten
and written constitution often sort of fit
hand and glove.
So, I could say fine.
Let's go back to the preamble.
We, the people of the United States do
ordain and establish this Constitution.
I'm interested in
that little word do.
We do.
What did we do?
How did we do it?
And I said we did it though epic free
speech, political opinion pro and con
up and down the continent and without that
the constitution perhaps couldn't have
even come into
an existence if there had been, if
existing
Governments had tried State Governments
shut down criticism
of State Governments because State
Governments were doing
a lot of things that were really
ineffective
and, and, and the Articles of
Confederation was basically feckless.
it, it, it, was, it was weak.
It was imbecilc, it wasn't working.
And unless ordinary people could say the
Articles Confederation is a joke and
the people in our state governments don't
know what the heck they're doing.
Unless you can actually get up and say
that, maybe you can't persuade your
fellow citizens that they should before
for
this bold new plan called the
Constitution.
So James Madison, in fact, at a very key
moment in American History,
when, when John Adams is actually
supporting, as
President, censorship measures, James
Madison said wait a minute.
If we'd have censorship measures like this
in place
in, in 1787-88, we wouldn't of even had
the Constitution!
So he is appealing to this very fact
that free speech was baked in the
constitutional cake.
Is James Madison the guy who, in case you
missed it,
authored the First Amendment during an
early version of the First Amendment.
James Wilson, the man who writes the
words,
We the People, at Philadelphia a great
constitutional
lawyer; one of only six men to sign both
the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution, one of
the first justices, associate just on the
Supreme Court.
James Wilson, while they're deliberating
on the Constitution in
1787-88, says, we are, are, are talking
about this thing.
Look, we are peacefully
changing our, our system of government.
It's not just that we're, we are saying
things, we're doing things.
We ourselves are embodying this
extraordinary free speech.
So Wilson notices this at the founding.
Madison notices this very shortly
thereafter that what we the people are,
actually doing in 1787.
We do,
that's part of the Constitution itself.
I can make it a textual argument, I think,
if you, if you twist my arm.
But I'm saying, you know, it, it's
also a historical argument, about what
actually happened.
It's a structural argument about the
Constitution as whole.
I think the most important thing to
understand is it's a good argument.
It's a legal argument.
It's a constitutional argument that free
speech is part of our DNA,
as a, a, Americans, as inheritors of, of,
of this constitutional project.
And not just free speech, but majority
rule.
Let's look at another thing that Americans
actually did in this redo moment.
How did we adopt the Constitution?
Well, we adopted it in state conventions.
And the Constitution says that nine states
have to say yes.
And unless nine states say yes it doesn't
go into effect.
Okay, great, and it will only go into
effect among
the states that say yes, and that makes
sense because before the constitution each
state is sovereign.
It's its own strictly speaking legal
entity.
It's in league and a confederation with
others.
But, if 12 states say yes, but Rhode
Island doesn't; Rhode Island in
1788 can't be bound by the other 12
because she's her own sovereign nation.
She's free to go it alone.
So Article 7 of the Constitution says, any
nine states suffice and
it will go in to affect among those nine.
Fine.
And by the way, Rhode Island and North
Carolina say no initially.
There, remember only 11 states say yes
when George Washington actually
is swearing the oath to be President of
the United States.
And, and Rhode Island and North Carolina
come in only afterward, after Madison
proposes
a Bill of Rights to bring them on board,
to remember all of that.
Article 7 is one sentence, its kind of,
the last
sentence of the Constitution that balances
the preamble, says nine states
will suffice and conventions within each
state will speak for the people.
They are the authentic embodiment of
the people, these specially elected
conventions.
You remember that property qualifications
were lowered or eliminated
in most of the states for these special
convention elections.
So remember all of that.
Article 7 says nine states suffices
and, and convention and it would go into
affect only among the nine.
And the conventions are the authentic
voice of the people of each state, fine.
But what should be the rule within the
convention?
Does the convention have to say yes, we do
in New York by
a 2 3rds vote, by a 3 5th votes, by a
unanimous vote?
And here's the kick in the head, the
Constitution
doesn't say, it's unwritten, but in every
single state it is
simple majority rule that does the trick
and that kind of goes without saying.
It's unwritten.
In New York the vote is actually 30 to 27
the barest of majorities.
Two votes changes it and in fact,
actually, probably one vote changes it.
because if one vote is switched, instead
of being 30 to 27,
in this ratifying convention in
Poughkeepsie, it would have been 29 to 28.
And the chair was actually opposed to the
Constitution,
would have been able to cast a tie making,
not a tie breaking, but a tie making vote,
making it 28 to 28, and then the
resolution fails.
Excuse me, 29 to 29 and then the
resolution fails.
That presiding
officer was George Clinton.
He was really opposed to the Constitution.
He's going to later become Vice President
of the United States because America
doesn't penalize
the people who raised doubts about the
thing,
who helped give us the Bill of Rights.
There's this epic free speech, as
mentioned before, but also majority rule.
And the minority immediately acquiesces in
this, in state after state after state.
I think partly because they
feel that they were allowed to be heard.
They weren't shut down.
Okay.
You let us make our case, make the
argument against it.
You often, you try to answer our
arguments.
And some anti-federalists, in some states,
they make arguments against the
Constitution.
And in the convention, someone says, well
that's
a good point, but here's the answer to it.
And the first guy says, okay.
I'm persuaded on that, let's move to the
next point.
They, they, [LAUGH], they're actually
talking to
each other which is democracy at its best.
But, because the
minority got to speak and wasn't shut
down, it acquiesced and simple majority
rules.
So, majority rule is another
basic, yet albeit unwritten,
constitutional principle.
It's baked into the cake.
In many states, the state constitutions
had seemed to say, you need a super
majority, several of the states, at least
and Massachusetts being one, and
Pennsylvania being another.
The state constitutions could have been
read to say you need a super
majority to change the government and
adopting
the U.S. Constitution is changing the
government.
It's changing the state government because
it's changing its relationship to
a, and, and it's legal status in all sorts
of ways.
so, when you in Massachusetts adopt the
U.S. Constitution,
you are thereby changing the Massachusetts
Constitution in various
ways and the Massachusetts Constitution,
which was on the books in the 1780's, the
Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 could
have been
read to say, it has to be super-majority.
But, in fact, it was read, in this year
that changed everything, as
requiring only a simple majority in a
ratifying convention to change the basic
rules.
The majority rule baked into the cake as a
basic unwritten principle.
Have I made a philosophical argument or a
structural argument?
No, I've been making an historical
argument about how
we the people, in this year, in fact did
it.
And we did it by majority rule in state
after state after state.
We did it with free speech in state after
state.
Now what follows from that?
Well, it might follow from that that every
state
can change its state constitution by
simple majoritarian processes.
Now
and in the future, whether or not the
state
constitution explicitly provides for a
simple majority rule amendment procedures.
And in fact, many, many states, in every
region of
the country, after the Constitution, did
in fact change their state
constitutions by simple majority rule pro,
procedures, even though those procedures
weren't in every sit, case specified in
the pre-existing state constitution.
So that,
that, that year that changed everything
did set precedence for
on the status of majority rule for state
constitutional amendment.
On the supreme court, if the vote is 5 to
4 who wins?
Yes, the 5.
All of us, you know.
The 5 if they want to prevail over the 4.
The 5 might choose to be deferential to
the 4 in all sorts of ways.
But push comes to shove, 5 beats 4 on the
Supreme
Court every time, if the 5 are emphatic
about it and
the constitution doesn't say that in so
many words.
It doesn't say majority rule.
How did the first house of
representatives, when it's getting started
it has
to come up with rules for its procedure,
how did it operate majority rule?
How did the first senate operate, when its
first gazed at majority rule?
Even though the Constitution doesn't say
so.
And so, in fact, I mean this is, this,
this small little conceptual tool, this
idea of paying
attention to how the constitution was
ordained
and established, it has huge implications
even today.
For those people who believe in filibuster
reform in the
Senate, the Senate today has rules that
some people think are
entrenched and they require super
majorities; 60 votes, 67 votes, and
you can't change them, without getting 60
votes, or 67 votes.
Fifty one senators think some folks can't,
if they're determined,
change the rules of the Senate.
And I say, absolutely, they can, because a
deep, unwritten, if unwritten
constitutional principle is majority rule.
It was baked into the constitutional cake.
It's part of our constitutional system.
And therefore, on any day, 51 senators, if
they're emphatic about the thing, have the
ability, have the right to change the
senate's
entrenched filibuster rules by appealing
to this deep
constitutional principle that was part of
their very process by which
we the people did in fact, ordain and
establish the Constitution.
Well, so much for this lecture in the next
lecture I'm going to talk about principles
that we can deduce, not from the founding
moment of ordained
establishment, but from the reconstruction
from amendments, because we can also
pay attention, not just to how America's
actually ordained the
Constitution, but how Americans did, in
fact, amend the Constitution.
So that's the next lecture.
So stay tuned, and I'll explain to you
what this is all about.
How, how the process by which America
amended the Constitution in the 1860s
after the civil war has very interesting
implications for the constitutionality of
the draft.
Stay tuned.
