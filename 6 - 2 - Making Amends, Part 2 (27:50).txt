Welcome back.
Let's talk about the first ten amendments
to the Constitution.
We call them the Bill of Rights, even
though that
phrase doesn't appear in the Constitution
itself, and indeed wasn't always
used and regularly used to describe these
amendments in at
least, in Supreme Court cases until much
later in American history.
I will tell you a story about, about how
that phrase
comes to become much more common in later
lectures.
Basically, just a foreshadow, the framers
of the 14th amendment after the Civil War
like to refer to these amendments as the
Bill of Rights, and, and that caught fire.
But these amendments were proposed in the
first Congress
in 1789, and ratified shortly thereafter,
1791.
And today there absolutely central
and iconic.
Not so much actually in the early period.
They don't mean that much on the ground
for much of early
America in history but they come to become
absolutely huge.
The big themes of these early amendments
are Federalism, or
Localism, if you will, and Populism.
These amendments to some extent, are
a reflection of a kind of Anti-Federalist
critique of the original constitution.
Remember the Anti-Federalists were worried
that the constitution created
too powerful a central government without
enough checks on it.
They were, they were nervous and they also
wanted to
beef up state and local power to some
extent as a
counterweight against federal authority.
Remember, the American constitution
follows the American Revolution.
And the revolution was a revolution
against an imperial center.
A revolution led by an an, aff an affili
an alliance of, of local
governments colonial assemblies and local
juries, local militias.
And the, the constitution was proposing
this vast, powerful
federal government, continental government
the likes of which supposedly Democratic
or Republican central government the likes
of which really
hadn't been seen in world history, and
anti-federalists were worried.
And they said that during the ratification
convention, and the Bill of Rights that
emerges,
to some degree, is a reflection of their
concerns.
It begins with the words, Congress shall
make no law of a certain sort.
By this, laws restricting free expression,
wealth and religious freedom.
So, begins Congress shall make no law of a
certain sort, ends with
a tenth amendment affirming, basically,
state's rights
and the idea of limited federal power.
All of these amendments
limit the Federal Government and only the
Federal Government.
Because the Anti-Federals were nervous
about the Federal Government.
And James Madison, who proposes these
amendments in the first
congress, he actually thinks that states
need to be restricted too.
He proposes the amendment that no state
should
bridge free speech or free press or
Religious freedom.
But actually Congress doesn't go along
with that.
The Senate basically nixes that idea.
The Senate is,
remember, controlled by people elected by
state legislatures.
It, it's a bastion of, of state's rights
to some extent.
And so Madison thinks we need a Bill of
Rights against the local governments as
well as against the center, and I think
ultimately, history has proved Madison
right on that.
But we don't really get that second bill
of rights, that bill
of rights against the central gov against,
excuse me a, a, a state
governments and local governments until
after the civil war.
So, our Bill of Rights begins congress
shall make no law, and only after the
Civil War do we get the Madisonian
supplement, no state shall abridge certain
fundamental rights.
So the localism idea, you see it in the
First Amendment, Congress can't pass laws.
Congress can't establish a, a national
church.
But actually
states can have established churches.
And some did.
And not only can can Congress not
establish
a national church, Congress can't
disestablish state churches.
That would be a Congressional law
respecting on
the topic of, in reference to
establishment of religion.
And Congress simply has to butt out of
that.
Leave it up to states, local option.
It's a states rights provision to some
extent.
The very words, Congress shall make no law
is really a recognition that there's no
enumerated power over certain domains.
Congress just has to butt out of certain
areas.
so, the first amendment has a federalism
component.
The second amendment is about protecting,
to some
extent, state militias against a central
standing army.
There is anxiety about an army and suppose
it becomes a military
dictatorship, well, local militias could
resist if there's a national military coup
of sorts, just as local militias had, had,
arrayed themselves
against the kingsmen, in places like
Lexington and Concord and
Bunker's Hill, so that's a localist
amendment that the jury
idea, excuse me, a militia idea is a local
idea.
I'm getting ahead of my self.
So is the Jury idea.
What you see in a bunch of other
amendment.
Juries are local bodies.
A resisting to some extent or counter
balancing national judges.
The tenth amendment is another localist
idea.
Numerating federal powers and and, and
other things reserved to the state.
Which are the people.
The ninth amendment is a recognition that
again
at least in part the federal government is
a government of enumerated powers, and we
don't
want those powers to be over broadly
construed.
So localism is an important
theme of these early amendments, and so is
populism, the phrase the people appears
in the first amendment, the right of
people to petition and assembly, assemble.
The second amendment, the right of the
people to keep and bear arms.
The fourth amendment, the ninth
amendament, the tenth
amendment, the people, the people, the
people, the people.
Why that phrase?
because remember where the Bill of Rights
in effect is coming from.
It's, it's coming
from the ratification conventions in 1787
88, when
we, the people of the United States got
together state by state by state, and
started
talking about whether we wanted to ratify
the Constitution.
And in that conversation, people said,
gee, the Philadelphia Framers goofed.
They forgot a bill of rights.
State constitutions have bills of rights.
We should have a federal bill of rights
too.
And so, the Constitution
the excuse me, the Bill of Rights kind of
bubbles up from
the people, from this democratic
conversation,
from epic acts of free speech
among the people and so it's not
surprising that the First Amendment
affirms the freedom of speech because it's
arising out of free speech.
It's not surprising that the first and the
second
and the fourth and the ninth and the tenth
speak
of the people, the rights of the people,
because this
is bubbling up from the people, from that
preamble process,
that we, the people process of ordainment
and
establishment; that's what we began the
course with.
That epic deed, the hinge of human
history.
When, for a year everyone is in a common
conversation up and
down the continent about how they and
their posterity are to be governed.
Let me just quickly run down for you what
the, these first ten amendments say.
The first amendment says that basically
there should be no federal suppression
of expression, free speech, free press.
And no federal interference
with religious rights and liberties.
So that's the first amendment.
And you see an idea of popular
sovereignty, because the people are
sovereign, ordinary people.
We should get to decide for ourselves how,
what our political ideas are.
Congress shouldn't try to tell us what
to say politically, what to think
politically.
They work for us.
We should, we the people are sovereign, so
they
can't tell us that we can't hear certain
things.
By the way, if you believe that deep
idea of popular sovereignty, you should
think state governments.
They work for us too.
They shouldn't be able to shut down
political discourse.
Incumbents shouldn't be able to, to, to
tell their challengers, their political
opponents to, to, to, to pipe down or, or
to shut up.
But the first amendment doesn't quite say
that in so many words.
It says Congress can't abridge free
speech.
Doesn't say states can't, and states
actually, although promising to
abide by free speech and free press in
their state
constitutions, actually, we're going to
see later in our story, especially
in the South, state governments try to
shut down free speech.
State governments in the antebellum era
make it
a crime, a capital offense to criticize
slavery.
The First Amendment's words don't regulate
states as such.
They don't say no state shall, they say
Congress shall make no law.
But after the Civil War, there's going to
be an explicit amendment saying, no
state shall violate fundamental rights,
including
rights of free speech and free press.
And you might think that principle was
implicit in
the basic structure of a republican form
of government,
in every state, a system of free and fair
elections, but the Bill of Rights doesn't
say so
in so many words.
It's to some extent a states rights,
anti-federalist document.
The second amendment, populism and, and
federalism.
Local militias keeping check on a Federal
army
just to make sure it doesn't tyrannize
over us.
We don't, we want to, the, the, the right
of the people is, is paramount here.
We don't want to basically governments to
be who has
the guns, who has the, the, the power.
We want the
military power, we want, actually, our
society to be
governed by what the people vote for, not
what the army prefers.
And, in case the army ever gets out of
line and tries to make itself into a
military dictatorship, George Washington
won't ever have any
part of that, of course; we're pretty sure
about
that, but what happens after him.
Well, state militias are going to be watch
dogs.
So populism and federalism here.
Militias are bodies representing the
people.
They're all of us.
They're cross sectional and they're
organized locally.
A third amendment says this army should be
quartered in, in, in, in, individual
private homes.
Again there's an unless
Congress Explicitly authorizes it again,
an anxiety about a protomilitary
industrial
complex, the culture within a culture, of
the military folks dominating others.
Back to the themes of national security
that
we've talked about so much in this course.
We need to create a federal, a strong
federal
military structure, but we need to keep it
in check
so that we tell them what to do, rather
than
that, him telling us what to do, and
think, and
how to live.
So the second and third amendment are sort
of military amendments about keeping
the federal military in check and again,
in the name of populism, popular
soveirnty.
The fourth amendament, today, no
unreasonable searches and seizures.
Today it's enforced by a thing called the
exclusionary rule.
We'll talk about that in later lectures.
In which, if evidence is acquired
improperly
by the government, even if it shows that
someone's clearly
guilty, it sometimes will be suppressed,
excluded from the trial.
The Framers didn't believe in any of that.
Their fourth amendment was more about the
rights of innocent people.
When the government became the central
government and, and rifle
through your papers, or, or invaded your
house improperly, unreasonable.
You could sue that official, for damages,
cause that was
an unreasonable and therefore,
unconstitutional
search and seizure, and who
would stand by you if you had a really
good case?
A local jury would.
You'd sue that government official in
trespass, they committed a torte against
you.
They, they entered your house.
They, they, they rifled through your
paper.
A jury, a local jury, would keep those
central officials in check.
So, fourth amendment idea is in part a
jury idea.
Fifth amendment has a takings clause.
If the federal government starts grabbing
your
property, you can sue for just
compensation.
And again, who might decide what that
piece of property is worth?
A local jury might.
And the fifth amendment talks about grand
juries.
And the sixth amendment talks about trial
juries and criminal cases.
And the seventh amendment talks about
civil juries.
Juries are a very big idea,
maybe the biggest idea of the original
Bill of Rights.
And two things about juries.
They're populist bodies.
They're the people.
Their localist bodies.
See the ways in which juries are kind of
like, malicious?
Local populists.
Malicious, to some extent, can be seen as,
sort of, jurists with guns in their hands.
This is an anti-federalist vision to some
extent.
Perfecting a little bit of skepticism
about the central government.
The eighth amendment says no cruel and
unusual punishments.
Well, who's going to be meeting out cruel
and unusual punishments possibly?
A judge.
A sentencing judge acting without a jury,
and we need to be worried about judges.
Acting without jury.
Remember, the founders created a powerful
judiciary but it
was still third out of three, the least
dangerous branch.
And they wanted to counterbalance judges
with a strong jury check
and balance just as you want to
counterbalance the senate with the house.
The ninth and
tenth amendments again, themes of populism
and federalism, the phrase that people
appears in both amendments and these
amendments are about limited Federal
power.
So, populism and federalism and
anti-Federalist vision to some extent.
Well, if it's anti-Federalist vision, why
do
Federalists like James Madison go for it?
Why is congress proposing a set
of amendments, the first Congress, that
begin,
he says ratified, Congress shall make no
law.
Why would Congress ever limit its own
power, you might wonder.
Why would the Federalist Madison go for a
series of amendments
that limits the federal government that
he's worked so hard to create?
And part of the answer is because the Bill
of Rights is part of a national
reconciliation project.
A bunch of people opposed the
Constitution.
The Constitution barely
passed in a whole bunch of places, and
Madison
and others want to bring those dissenters
on board.
And the way you bring them on board is by
taking
seriously their ideas, seeing if they
overlap with yours at all.
If you could find some common ground.
He wants to bring loyal Americans,
American patriots
who voted for the Constitution, but were
skeptical,
or who voted against the Constitution on
board,
he wants then to feel part of the project.
He wants North Carolina to ratify the
Constitution.
Remember, it hasn't yet when the first
Congress meets.
And geostrategically, you want North
Carolina.
He wants Rhode Island to ratify the
Constitution.
And this is a face saving measure.
You say to, to the, the North Carolinians,
to Rhode
Island people, you say you oppose the
constitution cause there's
not bill of rights, okay, well here,
here's some amendments
of the sort that you want, now, will you
come in?
And you can come in on face saving terms.
Madison also needed to get elected to
Congress, and he wasn't going to get
elected unless
he actually promised his constituents that
he would
rethink and, and propose a Bill of Rights.
That maybe he had made a mistake
in opposing the Bill of Right in
Philadelphia.
In principle, he wasn't opposed to it.
He needed to tell his constituents that in
order to
get elected to Congress, and he wants to
get re-elected.
And if he doesn't keep his
campaign promises, they're going to send
him packing.
And the other Congress people understand
that too.
And if they don't themselves propose some
amendments,
well remember, Article 5 says that is
Congress
tries to bottle up amendments that limit
Congress'
power, there's another way of proposing
constitutional amendments.
You can have a new convention called, but
does Congress want to lose control in the
process?
If they don't propose some reasonable
amendments maybe the
states will demand a new second
constitutional convention which will
adopt, which will propose a whole bunch
of radical amendments that Congress would
like better.
To maintain control of the, of the agenda
of the process.
And propose your own, sort of reasonable
amendments.
Your, your olive branch.
Your, your compromise.
And by the way if you're in Congress,
you're not probably expecting to be there
forever.
You're going to leave after a certain
point, and
when you leave you want Congress to be
limited.
Today people tend to stay in Congress for
very long,
periods of time but the founding wasn't as
true.
And, remember the ge, geography.
The distance you're going to be a long way
away
from your home, there's not jet travel
back and forth
and so people don't stay in congress
forever, the
way sometimes today it seems as if they,
they do.
So when the early Congress passes
amendments limiting
Congress, they're not just limiting
themselves, but their successors.
Some of them are imagining if they're
going to go home to the farm.
So that's the early amendments.
And as I said, they're not going to to
mean
very much on the ground for a long time.
The first time the United States Supreme
Court quotes an act
of Congress of unconstitutional as a
violation of the first amendment, 1965.
And it's not as if Congress hasn't
violated the First Amendment before that.
John Adams is going to sign his name to
the Alien Sedition Acts
that make it a crime to criticize the
federal government, a crime to criticize
the president.
Not withstanding what the First Amendment
said.
Within a decade, you're going to have a
repressive Congressional law.
And, courts actually don't enforce the
first amendment vigorously.
And in World War 1, again, people are
put in prison for criticizing the federal
government, Eugene
Debs, a guy who gets a million votes
for president, is put in prison for
basically saying
its a crummy war, and we shouldn't be in
it.
So these amendments are passed.
And it's important as part of the
reconciliation project, but they don't
quite fully
mean a lot on the ground in court until
much later in our constitutional story.
And, and they're going to mean a lot more
later on in part because of
the 14th Amendment that takes these rights
and applies them against state and local
governments,
as well as Congress.
And the Supreme Court is more, comfortable
beating up
on state and local governments, and only
once its
done that will it build up all sorts of
cases and principles about the, the Bill
of Rights.
And they can them start to apply against
the Federal government.
That's going to be a big theme of later
lectures, so hold that thought.
Those are the first ten amendments.
An eleventh emerges soon thereafter.
It's about limiting federal courts that
have been
a little too aggressive.
Remember the ska, framers.
The founding generation, you know, didn't
have as robust a
conception of judicial power then we, as
we have today.
The early Supreme Court was just a shadow
of what it is today.
It didn't get to decide most of the
important constitutional cases of its era.
And the one early case that it does decide
before John Marshall comes along.
Case called Chisholm versus Georgia,
people immediately react badly to that.
They,
oppose it, and the eleventh amendment is
introduced to overturn a Supreme Court
case, where
the Supreme Court, critics say, has gone
too
far and accumulated too much power for
itself.
I don't want to go into all the details, I
just
want to, they're very technical, if you
want, there's much more
information in the book about them, but
for now just see
how story of skepticism of Federal power,
and even judicial power.
Remember a lot of the amendments in
the Constitution are limiting judges and
judicial excesses.
By providing for juries and, and rights of
criminal defendants, no against double
jeopardy and compelled self-incrimination,
and against secret trials.
And like trials have to be public, and,
and speedy, and
all sorts of restrictions on judges in the
Bill of Rights.
I want to end on
this discussion of the early amendments
with the 12th
Amendment, which turns out to be a rather
important one.
Here's what you need to remember about the
founding presidency.
It wasn't designed with political parties
in mind.
Washington stands above party, everyone
votes, every elector votes for him for
president the first time around and then
again the second time around.
But when he leaves
the scene, actually you actually have
contests for the presidency and the
emergence of early political parties.
So as soon as Washington leaves the scene.
Remember, he's sort of preeminent.
You have the next set of founders, the
great men of the American Revolution,
coming forward.
Washington stood head and shoulders, in
some cases literally, above everyone else.
But when he leaves, when he says, I don't
want to be president for life.
Actually a republic should be bigger than
one man.
When he leaves in ways that Ho Chi Min
never does and Fidel never does and Mao
never does.
Well but he leaves the scene even
though he could've been re-elected.
The two men, who were the next, sort of
most prominent in the American revolution,
Adams and Jefferson come to the floor, and
they run against each other in 1796.
We're about to get the picture here.
Remember, every chapter has a picture, and
if you
understand the picture, you understand a
lot about the chapter.
They run against each other in 1796.
And Adams wins, Jefferson comes in second
and therefore becomes Vice President.
Under the founding system, if you come
in second for the presidency, you're Vice
President.
And initially they, they get along just a
little bit,
but they begin to become quite
antagonistic to each other.
Political parties emerge.
Adams is the head of one party, Jefferson
the other.
And, and then they run against each other
again
in the rematch in 1800 and that time,
Jefferson wins.
And in the wake of these sharply contested
elections, Americans
realize they need to change the rules of
the electoral
college, because the electoral college can
permit, basically, people who
really hate each other from being
President and Vice President together.
And that's, that's just not a very stable
system.
That's like an assassination incentive.
so, so they redesigned the rules of the
Electoral College
so that people can run as the
Presidential, Vice
Presidential team under the news rules of
the 12th Amendment.
Once and, and the new rules of, of, of
the,
of the 12th, of the 12th amendment, you
you have people
running separately for vice president, so
the vice president is
no longer the guy who comes in second for
the presidency.
The guy who may be actually completely
opposed to the guy, the person who wins.
Now you have tag teams,
president, vice president, a ticket, so to
speak.
The 12th Amendment, in other words, is
designed to facilitate political parties,
mass mobilization.
In a word, Democracy.
It's designed to actually make the world
safer.
A kind of Jefferson's democratic vision.
And so it fits our story of populism.
It's about actually encouraging energetic
elections and broad political
participation.
That is one other thing, as well.
So Jefferson very much is a small d
democrat and he's about national security.
He's going to, going to acquire Louisiana,
so he's fixed with that
story of national security and democracy,
but he's also pro-slavery.
He talks an anti-slavery game, but he
doesn't free his slaves.
He pursues pro-slavery policies and here's
what I
want you to notice about these two
elections.
It's North against South both times.
That's the dividing line in America.
The dividing line in America is not big
states against small states.
It's North against South.
And some people say oh the electoral
college prohibits regional candidates.
No, these are regional alignments both
times.
The Southerner, Jefferson, wins the South
both times.
The Northerner, Adams, wins the North both
times.
What's the swing state?
New York, in effect, is where north meets
South.
Today, it's
Ohio.
Those days it was New York, which was a
slave state.
New York, in the first election, votes for
Adams and
the second, thanks to Aaron Burr, votes
for Thomas Jefferson.
So he wins, it's north against south, and
here's what you need to notice.
That not only is America divided North
against South, but the South, Jefferson's
base, his slave-holding base, gets extra
electoral
votes because of slavery, three fifths
clause.
Adams understands and all of his
supporters understand.
That without those extra electoral votes
in the 1800's,
he would have won even the election of
1800.
Thomas Jefferson is ridding into the
Executive
mansion on the backs of his slaves.
The electoral college is a pro-slavery
institution, and it has some flaws and
they modified them with the 12th amendment
but they don't fix the proslavery flaw.
They build that.
They, they continue to perpetuate that
pro-slavery flaw, that 3 5ths
into article to in the, in the, in the
electoral college.
So an here we conclude.
Because of the 12th amendment, we're going
to have a pro-slavery Presidency.
It's more democratic yes.
Political parties are o.k.,
but it's going, we're going to move from
Jefferson to Jackson.
Very pro-slavery.
His party is going to dominate.
The dominant political party in America is
the,
the Democrat parties and they're the
pro-slavery policies.
They're going to put pro-slavery people on
the Supreme
Court, like Roger Taney on the Dred Scott
case.
And the war will come as a result of it.
Here's the ultimate irony, a 12th
amendment designed to pri, privilege
Jefferson's party, they called themselves
the Republicans, will
many years down the line, in 1860, these
rules about the electoral
college are designed basically to prop up
Jefferson's Republican party.
Will end up favoring, which is a
pro-slavery
party, they, they later call themselves
the Democrats.
These rules of the 12th Amendment designed
to prop up that
party will eventually come to benefit a
man named Abraham Lincoln.
A very different kind of Republican.
An anti-slavery Republican.
And when he
gets elected as the first
openly anti-slavery president in American
history.
Sort of despite the rigging of the game
in Article II against, sort of, his
worldview.
Against the Northern worldview.
When he comes to power, contesting
Dred Scott, which has been handed down by
Roger Tawney, appointed by Andrew Jackson,
sort of a Jeffersonian disciple.
When Lincoln comes to power, the 12th
Amendment
is going to be followed eventually by a
13th Amendment.
The pro-slavery 12th Amendment is going to
be followed by an emphatically
anti-slavery 13th Amendment, because in
between, the house divided will fall.
There will be a Civil War and in its wake,
the Union will be rebuilt.
A new house will emerge.
That's the story for next week.
So I hope I see you then.
Bye.
