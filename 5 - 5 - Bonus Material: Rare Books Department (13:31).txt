Hello again everyone.
As you may remember my name is Lauren
Biksacky, and I'm one
of your teaching assistant here for the
Constitutional Law Course series class.
I'm a third year student at Yale Law
School, and I actually am taking
the opportunity today to join a librarian
here at Yale Law School, Mike Widener.
Now, he is the Head Librarian for Yale Law
School's rare book collection.
And we're here
today to look at some of the primary
sources as well as secondary
sources related to the Constitution, that
Yale has in its rare book collection.
Now many of you have expressed comments
and questions
about some of these other sources related
to the constitution.
Specifically, you've asked about the
Federalist Papers
and some of the state ratifying
conventions.
And so we've prepared a set of some books
that you might be interested in.
And we hope that you'll take this
opportunity to learn more
about our constitution and maybe even
explore a local library yourself.
Now the first book we have here is a
debate about one of the state constitution
ratifying conventions.
Can you tell us a little bit about this
book?
>> Sure, first thanks for coming,
Lauren.
>> [LAUGH].
>> And this is a collection we want
people to use, so you're welcome to come
and
use the collection.
This first example we have here is a, of
the first edition of the debates of the
ratifying convention, in Massachusetts.
The convention took place in 1788, the
book came out in 1788.
So it came out very soon after the,
convention was over.
And it consists, really, of nothing but
newspaper
reports and the people who published the
book, were two newspapers.
So they put their, their material together
that they'd already reported in the
newspapers compiled it and got it out to
the reading public in, in, in a book form.
And this tells us a couple things about
the, the, the the text itself.
Newspaper publishers
are pretty good judges of their market.
They have a wide readership, and they
felt, probably,
that this book was going to have a wide
readership.
And because of the nature of the
ratification process, they were
probably thinking this may even have a
market outside of just Massachusetts.
How bout the other states that have not
yet taken a vote on ratifying the the
Constitution.
This was a way for Massachusetts to have
an influence on the other states.
So it's, it's interesting in that respect
looking
at it from a business and marketing
standpoint.
And what that tells about the process
behind it.
The whole ratification process.
>> Now in Professor Amar's lectures, he
really emphasizes that the
state ratifying conventions had a lower
bar for people to vote
for the ratification of the Constitution.
And, and what that means is, more people
could vote for
this than they could vote for anything
else in the past.
>> And so I can see why having these
printed in the newspapers for, for
the common people that have never had
the opportunity to vote, would be really
beneficial.
>> Sure, absolutely.
And and again newspapers are great judges
of markets like
this because they have to sell to the
common people.
So yeah it's
I think this is, is a great point.
Just show you just a few I mean this is
there, there's extensive debates,
And again these are newspaper sources, you
never sure how exactly accurate they are.
But they're probably had, had, they had
practice with these things.
This is one, example here of the debate
about a federal district.
Meaning what we now know of as the
District of Columbia.
And I know I, in reading this one
of the delegates speculates is this to
protect the
the legislators, the governors from
insult, you know
from people that are unhappy with what
they're doing.
That's why so anyways this is one one
example of some of the debates And
a lot of the issues that were debated here
are, are of interest even today.
The debates about slavery, how you're
going to count votes,
apportionment, all these things the
judiciary, all
these things were, were important at the
time.
>> Some of the students actually were
interested
in debates about, slavery, and
representation and vote counting.
And so they could actually go to either
internet or primary sources.
At their own libraries and read more about
these debates?
>> Absolutely, absolutely.
And and a lot of them have a lot of echos
with
current events today.
So, also make them of interest.
When we come to the back of the book
here, what you see here's the, the final
vote tally.
You, you have all the votes of the all the
delegates.
Their names, how they voted.
And the, the, kind of the ratifying
language.
And you see here, signed in type, you see
John Hancock.
The the proverbial
John Hancock appears right there on as
the.
>> That's his John Hancock.
>> That's his John Hancock in type.
So you see, this, so this is a, a, and
this is
also kind of an important as a public
record of, of sorts.
Not that this was an official record, but
this shows that there was a,
an official vote that, that the convention
went through steps to, to make their,
their decision official.
What's very interesting also, is at the
very end
you have about three, about two and a half
pages.
These are just statements of,
the people who voted nay.
Who said, and they're saying yes, I voted
against this.
I, I this was not only my belief but the
belief
of the people who sent me to the
convention to represent them.
But they're saying also but we recognize
this is a legitimate process.
That, that we abide by it and we can now
count on us to support the constitution,
from now on out.
so, it, it's, they're ratifying in essence
the process
that they just participated in, even
though they voted no.
Well, as Professor Amar outlined, nine of
the thirteen states needed to
ratify this Constitution through their
state
delegations, before it would come into
effect.
Now that we've talked a little bit about
the state ratifying conventions,
I'd like to show you an early version, an
early copy of
the Constitution, after it's been
ratified.
So next, we have an early copy of a
printed version of the Constitution.
Now, it's contained in a really large
book.
Mike, can you tell us a little bit about
what
this book is and who might have access to
it?
>> Yes, this book is a collection of
Connecticut statutes, session laws.
And, we can see
here, this is the the Acts of Laws of
Connecticut from 1784,
all post independence but there's several,
there's several volumes.
There are several books bound together
into one.
>> And what is at the front of this
book?
>> Well, that's what makes this book
really interesting.
This little pamphlet at the beginning is a
printing of the Constitution
of the United States.
It's un-dated, but it's a very early
printing.
And that's acknowledged in a lot of the
early bibliographies.
And at the bottom, this is actually a
relic of the ratification process here in
Connecticut.
because you see here, the statement at the
bottom.
In the name of the PEOPLE of the state of
Connecticut da, da, da, da, da, and they
ratify it and
it's dated Hartford, January 9th 1788.
So this probably came out very soon
afterwards.
>> And I'd like to point out just one
more thing
about this before we move on and that is
the text itself.
The size of the preamble verses the size
of the
original text of the constitution, the
articles of the constitution.
And as you can see, the text of the
preamble is almost double the size of the
articles.
And that really highlights what Professor
Amar
has highlighted in his lectures to you.
Which is that We the People of the United
States ordain this
Constitution, and the preamble highlights
the importance of democracy in our system.
Well, now we've looked at an early copy of
the
Constitution and I'd like to take a look
at one
more prized piece of the rare book
collection
here at Yale, and that is the Federalist
Paper.
Lastly, I have one of the jewels of the
Yale Law School's
rare book collection, and that is the
first edition of The Federalist.
Mike, what can you tell us about this
first edition?
>> Well, it's a, it's a great book.
One of the classics of political science
in the world.
This The Federalist, began also as a
collection of newspaper articles.
It's
>> So, the people had access to these
articles?
>> That's right, they had access to it.
It's, you can actually think of it, really
as a piece of political propaganda.
This was, a sales job for selling the
Constitution.
And so it came out in two volumes, but not
at the same time.
The first the first volume collects essays
that had already been published in the
newspaper.
The second volume
which came out a couple of months later
has some others that appeared in
the newspaper and some that appear in the
book form, for the first time.
>> So, those weren't available for the
people to read at the ratification?
>> yes.
Yeah well, it depends on when the
ratification took place.
But they were in circulation.
So either in book form or as as newspaper.
So it's
a extremely important book.
It's a piece of political propaganda.
They're selling the Constitution.
They're trying to convince people that
this
Constitution that's been passed is worthy
of ratification.
It's the best way for the nation to go
forward.
So there it's, it's a sales job.
And so, and it's been enormously
influential.
People still
are arguing over it today.
There's been dozens and dozens and dozens
of editions of the The Federalist.
It's still important in debates and so
forth
to this day just as work of political
science.
It's really a monument in world
literature.
>> So at the time, we didn't know who
actually wrote these pieces?
>> Another thing about this particular,
the first edition, is we still
don't have the authors' names appearing
here.
We don't know that it's at least at least
not in print, that
it's Hamilton and Jay and Madison that are
authors of this, of these essays.
And there's something else there's a
couple other special things about our copy
of the first edition of The Federalist
that I'd like to show you.
Our copy is still in its original, kind of
very primitive form.
These are cheap, temporary pasteboard
covers that normally would've been
replaced.
This is probably how the book looked like
when it was purchased from the bookseller.
The, the pages are untrimmed, for
collectors.
Collectors go ga-ga over these books,
because there
are, they're still, you know, as close to
original condition as possible.
And that's why we're really happy to have
them, this copy.
The other thing about this copy, it
was owned by General Samuel McClellan, a
Connecticut
man who was a veteran of the Battles of
Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill.
And one of his descendants donated this
book to us in the 1940s.
So we're very, very happy and
honored to have this copy.
>> Mike, this was a great opportunity
for me and for our students that are
watching online to see some of the jewels
of the Yale Law Library rare book
collection.
I'd like to thank you for your time, and.
>> It was a pleasure, thank you for
coming.
>> And sharing this experience with
everyone.
>> Sure.
I know that I speak for myself and
probably you as
well, to say that Librarians love showing
people books, they love,
they love talking about the books.
You know Mike is just one of many
public libraries as well as university
libraries all
around and I'd encourage all of you to
explore some of the resources that your
libraries have.
And who knows, you know, maybe you'll
stumble
on something that people have overlooked
in the past.
Like the, the size of the text of the
preamble or anything else.
And so many great thinkers and scholars
learn from the primary sources.
And we hope that you explore them as well.
I look forward to seeing you all and
talking to you
on the discussion boards and in the future
with our bonus footage.
Have a great day.
