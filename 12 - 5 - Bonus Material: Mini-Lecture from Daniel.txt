Hi.
Welcome to another week of bonus materials
for Professor Akhil Amar's Constitutional
Law Coursera class.
I'm Daniel, one of your TFS.
Today I wanted to discuss a current event
that brings
up a lot of the issues that we've been
discussing.
In the course of Professor Amar's
lectures,
and some of the other bonus materials.
That's the recent Supreme Court case of
McCutcheon V FEC which is
a constitutional law case that's been
getting a lot of press recently.
The Supreme Court handed down its opinion
in the case just a couple weeks ago.
And what the case was about was the
constitutionality of campaign
contribution limits established under the
federal election campaign act of 1971.
So, that act is one of the kind of
primary bastions of campaign finance
regulation in the United States.
And it sets out a couple of things.
It both says how much you can contribute
to any individual campaign or any
individual candidate.
Then it also puts in place aggregate
limits.
That say how much you can one person can
spend in an, across
all candidates, across all donations they
want to make in a given election cycle.
Currently limit that is around $120,000,
depending on exactly how you slice it.
so, this challenge was brought by a man
named
Shaun McCutcheon, hence the name
McCutcheon of the FEC.
In which the, and he, he said, you know,
these limits were restricting my ability
to engage in
political speech, because I made the
maximum number of
contributions, and I still wanted to
donate more candidates.
I wanted to express myself, using money,
in more
ways, and the government was not letting
me do that.
That's a violation of my First Amendment
rights.
So this is a case that arises under the
first amendment,
which is something we've talked about
pretty extensively in this course.
And just to remind you, the first
amendment says, the Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of
religion
or prohibiting the free exercise there of.
That's the religion part, it's not as
relevant but,
then it says, or abridging the freedom of
speech.
So,
as you can see, that text doesn't
necessarily give
us that much to go off of on its own.
It's pretty vague.
It says abridging the freedom of speech.
What does that mean?
Surely it doesn't mean that Congress can
make no laws concerning speech of any
kind.
We have plenty of laws outlawing things
like libel, right?
Or outlawing things like sharing secrets
of the United States government.
There are clearly cases where the
government can restrict speech.
The question is where and why.
And one big issue that comes up under the
First Amendment is to what extent can the
government regulate.
People's participation in elections, which
often, in the
present world, takes the form of
contributing money.
So when the court is trying to figure out,
well, what restrictions
are permissible, what restrictions aren't
permissible,
under vague texts like the first
amendment.
Often they look at precedents, look at
what the court has done before.
And we've talked a lot about reasoning
from precedent and the role that past
cases
play in some of our lectures addressing
the things brought up in Professor Mars's
book.
America's Unwritten Constitution.
So this case presents a great example of
how that works, because it largely dealt
with
a framework set up in a, famous Supreme
Court case from 1976 called Buckley vs
Ohio.
And in Buckley V Valeo, the Court made a
distinction, which has endured
to this day, between expenditures on the
one hand, and contributions on the other.
So what the Court said was, you can't, it,
it, it, it's, you have to have very
compelling reasons if you want to
regulate, expenditures that a
campaign makes, so what a campaign
actually spends But
you have a little bit more leeway under
the first amendment to regulate people
contributions, so if
people want to give money to campaigns
There's more
leeway to restrict that, especially if you
are trying
to restrict actual corruption or the
appearance of corruption.
We don't want to make it look like people
can buy politicians.
We kind quid pro quo arrangement where I
donate
to your campaign and in return for your
behavior later.
so, in the aftermath of Buckley V Valeo
that kind of campaign finance, regime that
we've developed,
as I mentioned earlier, has both
restrictions on
the contributions you can make to any
individual campaign.
And then also restrictions on how many
contributions you can make total, across
multiple campaigns.
so, here in this case someone brought a
challenge, [INAUDIBLE] brought a challenge
to the aggregate limits.
And the Court was looking at its past
precedents, looking at Buckley V Valeo,
looking at a
lot of other doctrine that's developed
since then, including
Citizens United which I'll get to in a
second.
And asking whether this limit on aggregate
expenditures is
actually permissible in light of all the
precedents we have.
And so so what kind of reasoning do they
engage in?
To do this inquiry.
So they start from the premise that there
are very
serious First Amendment interests that are
implicated in this case, and
that's because contributing money is, at
least in some sense, an
exercise of the individual's right to
participate in the electoral process.
That's the court's reasoning, you know,
that the way
that you make your voice heard in the
modern political
process often is by contributing money to
a campaign
you say Look, this is an issue I care
about.
This is a politician I care about.
And so I'm going to make my voice heard by
giving money
to that cause, by making that politician
more likely to get elected.
So as a result, if the government is
going to
restrict this kind of fundamental First
Amendment, right, First
Amendment interest, according to the
Court's reasoning, it needs
a, it needs a very compelling reason to do
so.
And the means that it uses in order to, to
forward that reason
have to be kind of narrowly tailored to
the interest that it's serving.
So the core here says we agree that the
government does have an interest;
but it's a pretty narrow interest in
preventing quid pro quo corruption, which
is
basically bribery or close to it Where you
actually make a contribution with the
explicit expectation that a politician is
going to
act the way you want in the future.
and, what the Court said is, you know,
aggregate campaign spending limits aren't
really closely tailored to this rule at
all, because
They don't prevent, an individual from
giving so much money to
any individual candidate that that
candidate
would feel beholden to the donor.
That's what base, campaign limits are for,
right?
That's what the limits that say, you can
only
donate X amount of dollars to a particular
candidate do.
And so, as a result these, these, these
limits on how many different
candidates you can donate to, how many
money you can give across the board.
Don't really forward this clear, this
interest in preventing quid pro quo
corruption.
That's the court's reasoning, and, they
say that, you
know, the, the fear that, well, maybe if
there were
no aggregate limits people could donate to
multiple entities that
would then in turn donate that money to an
individual.
They say, this, this, the court said this
is too speculative.
That's not really something we're too
concerned about.
And the Court also says we're not
concerned, we don't recognize a
compelling government interest in reducing
the amount of money in politics, or
in, kind of, reducing the appearance of a
culture in which money drives politics,
The, the, the courts recognize interests
here are, are much narrower.
They're about actual kind of quid pro quo
corruption.
so, as a result of all that, what the
court says is, these aggregate campaign
spending limits don't, aren't closely
tailored to the interests we recognize.
They are, as a result, an
unconstitutional restriction on
individuals' political speech rights.
So they struck down those limits.
A lot of people are either, some people
are
happy about it, some people are very
concerned about it.
But I want to now that we kind of laid out
what happened, just talk about a couple
interesting implications of it.
So, so, one question, and, and I think a
couple people actually brought this
up in some of the discussion forums, is
how does this relate to Citizens United?
So Citizens United V FEC it's a case from
a few years ago.
That, was also about campaign finance,
that also struck down,
campaign finance laws restricting the kind
of expenditures that corporations actually
engage in.
And it also generated a ton of press.
So how do those two key, how does
this case, McKutcheon, relate to that
case, Citizens United.
so, at a high level, you could first say
they're not exactly about the same thing.
Citizens United was about the the
political speech rights of corporations
and kind of what types of expenditures
corporations could engage in.
This case McCuthen is about the aggregate
contribution limits.
Remember I mentioned earlier that there's
a distinction between expenditures and
contributions.
So Citizens United is really an
expenditure case, this is really a
contribution
case So, so it's not exactly the same, the
same type of situation.
But they are clearly, thematically linked
and also practically linked.
So first thematically they are both part
of a
trend over the past last almost decade at
this point.
In which the Court has engaged in very
rigorous
review of campaign finance laws frequently
striking them down.
There have been actually been six
campaign finance opinions related to First
Amendment
challenges to the campaign finance law,
since
Justice Alito and Roberts joined the
Court.
And all of them have upheld the First
Amendment claim, so, you know,
that's bad for campaign finance law, if
you're a fan of campaign finance law.
And all of them, except for one of the
five-four decisions, so
there's certainly at least a particular
block of this core that's very interested.
And asserting first amendment rights for
political speech and
scaling back campaign finance reforms and
restrictions as a result.
And this is the latest substantiation of
that, Citizens United was another example
both cases had, the, the same lineup in
terms of justices.
Voting for them.
So so then, I think both cases also, if
you're going to talk about thematic links
reflect a kind of
narrow view of what corruption means of
what the government's interest
in regulating campaign expenditures or
contributions actually are.
And this is what I mentioned earlier.
They kind of narrow quid pro quo
corruption.
The kind of most clear sort of be-latent
forms of corruption, where
I just give you money in return for some
sort of promise.
And are less concerned with the idea that.
There's a kind of collective interest that
we
all have in having a political process
that
feels fair, or that feels responsive to
the
interests of everyday people rather than
the rich.
The, the court has generally been
dismissive of kind of
of that sort of larger, systemic interest
and more
concerned with the individual rights of
people who want
to have their opinions heard in the
political process.
So, the first amendment is really about
protecting those individual rights.
And that led to the Citizens United result
that led to the result here.
Excited different ways.
Another link, and this one's practical,
rather than
kind of thematic, is that, so, Citizens
United established
that corporations share many of the
political speech rights
of people, so presumably, if individuals
are not limited.
By aggregate's spending limits, either are
corporations.
So this means that corporations, if they
want to contribute to political campaigns
will
still be subject to certain limits on
how much they can contribute to any
individual.
But not limits on how much they can donate
in aggregate.
So theoretically McCutchen does open the
door, not just for wealthy individuals.
But also wealthy corporations to donate
massive sums of
money across many different candidates
within the same election cycle.
And understandably, a lot of people are
potentially concerned about this.
They say look, you know, this He's only
going
to add to the perception that money
dominates politics.
That politics is for special interests of
the rich, it's not for ordinary people.
But on the flip side there are others that
say this is what the first
amendment is about, the first amendment is
about
individuals rights to participate in the
political process.
It may not always be popular, but
sometimes you
know, justice Robertson, uses McCutchin
and he knows this.
Sometimes First Amendment requires you to
defend
unpopular speech, whether it's the right
of
Nazi's to march, or it's the right of
people to protest at military funerals.
And in this case the simple that maybe
it's unpopular for wealthy individuals to
donate lots of money to Political
campaigns
and advance causes that they care about.
That doesn't mean that we can stop them,
it doesn't mean we can silence them.
That's what the First Amendment's about.
So, you know, I mean, both both sides of
the spectrum
have a lot to say about this side of the
issue.
One other kind of larger point he brings
up
is this issue of judicial activism verses
judicial restraint.
Which are terms you may have heard thrown
about
at one point or another Often you hear the
claim
that at least from the conservative side
of the spectrum,
that liberals and liberal justices will
engage in judicial activism.
Will try and, go beyond say, the the text
of the statute or consti, the Consitution
in order to kind of pronounce broad right
or engage in sort of legislating from the
bench, that's a phrase
you sometimes hear, but I think as this
case shows Judicial restraint.
And no party or no political ideology has
a monopoly on judicial restraint.
In fact, if you look at the opinions in
Citizens United, you see the, you know,
Justice Breyer's dissent.
You know, Justice Breyer is often
characterized as a liberal justice, making
some of these same judicial activism
charges that you often hear from
conservatives.
Saying, well, look, the real thing,
judicial restraint here
means letting the political branches pass
the laws they want.
Where you have here a conservative
majority engaging in judicial activism by
imposing
their view of the political process, the
First Amendment, on, on the political
branches.
So I think the case is a
nice illustration that who's exhibiting
traditional restraint and
who isn't often depends on where you're
sitting
hard to reliably say in an objective way.
so, what comes next?
As many people have noted, this could be a
prelude.
It likely is to even more challenges to
campaign finance laws.
the, this time, it was about aggregate
campaign spending limits, but maybe next
time, it'll
be about the base limits themselves, about
the limits on how much you can donate.
To any individual campaign, and maybe
Buckley V Valeo's distinction between
expenditures and contributions is just
going to be thrown out the window.
And we're going to move to a regime where
it's
very difficult to regulate any aspect of
political spending.
Another possibility, though, and this is
something else people have suggested, is.
Maybe, as a result, we have a
Constitutional Amendment, and this
is something that Amar talks about in a
number of places.
And then we've brought up in a lot of
lectures in this course.
The Constitution isn't fixed.
If we decide that some outcome that
follows from the
constitutional text isn't something that
we want, isn't something that we
want to be part of our political
community, like, say, An
inability to, regulate campaign
contributions
and expenditures, can change the
Constitution.
And perhaps if people are outraged about
what some of
the Court's holdings on, the First
Amendment entail for the
political process, this would be an
opportunity to think about
how we want the Constitution to look in
the future.
So I encourage you if you're curious to
read
more about this case, to check it out on
the
internet, because there are literally
thousands of different opinions
you can find addressing all different
aspects of this case.
so, really just scratched the surface
here, but
I hope this gave a chance to think about
how some of the issues that we're
discussing in
this course play out in a real world
context.
So, thanks a lot, and look forward to
seeing you soon.
