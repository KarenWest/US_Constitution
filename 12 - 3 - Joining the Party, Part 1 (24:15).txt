Welcome back.
In this lecture and the next one, I'm
going to be talking about chapter
ten of the book, America's Unwritten
Constitution,
the chapter is entitled Joining the Party.
America's partisan constitution.
We're going to talk about the role
of political parties in our constitutional
system.
We have a basic two party system in
America.
It's as prominent and
as a practical matter, fixed feature of
our system as.
The Mississippi River is a fixed and
indelible feature of of of.
Of the land mass or The Rocky Mountain's
or with the Grand Canyon.
These are basic fundamental features of
the American natural landscape and
the two party system is a basic.
Fundamental feature of America's legal and
political landscape.
It is for all intents and purposes, a very
important
feature of America's Constitution, how the
system actually is constituted and works.
Now You may have been told that the
Constitution
itself makes absolutely no mention of
political parties.
And that in fact the Constitution in its
structure
and spirit and history is opposed to
political parties.
And the truth is a little bit more
complicated than that.
In fact, the Constitution itself The
written constitution the Turst text
does, openly acknowledged in letter and
spirit the, the role of
political parties, but, as I said, it's a
slightly more
complicated story, it didn't quite do so
at the founding.
At the founding many of you of course may
have been taught that the
Federalist number 10 in which James
Madison argues
against, or is critical of the idea of
factions,
hyper-partisanship in the system.
And he does
argue against a certain thing called
faction but what you may not have
recalled is that later in life James
Madison becomes
a total political operative, a partisan
operative,
he.
In the late 18th century, a decade after
writing federalist 10 basically is the
co-founder
of a political party.
They called themselves the republicans at
the time, they will become the modern
democrat party.
A basicallly successor to the party that
Jefferson and Madison co found.
So James Madison within a decade
of writing a anti factional Federalist
number 10.
Becomes the leader really, the political
organizer of a group a faction.
If you will he.
Is Carl Rove, of, the of his, of his era.
A Martin Van Buren like political
organizer and operative.
And we're going to talk about that.
And, and that vision of partizinship.
And its permissibility, that, that you see
in the later Madison's writings
is reflected in Constitutional amendments
because, yes the original
constitution didn't, wha-, did not image a
two party system emerging.
But the amended constitution very much
reflects
the a, a, a two party system reality.
So, let's, let's start by looking at the
structure of the original presidency.
Because the original presidency I think
does explain this intuition that the
framers
didn't really expect political parties to
emerge and political parties emerge
actually intention
with the structure of the constitution,
and there is as I said, some, some truth
to this and, but today's constitution Is
different than the founders' Constitution.
So remember what the founders' rules were
for presidential
selection.
Basically you the
presidential electors, the electoral
college, so to speak, that were chosen in
each state, Each elector voted for two
people for President.
And the top two vote getters became
President and
Vice President, respectively.
There was no separate ballot for the Vice
President.
Two votes for presidency, and the top two
vote getters became
President and Vice President respectively,
and when you think about it.
In a two-party system, this is perhaps a
disaster waiting to happen.
Imagine that you've got two party
chieftans, and they run against each other
in a pretty fierce campaign.
And now, but they end up being number one
and two in, in the vote tally.
And that, there are all sorts of scenarios
In which
that could happen, and indeed, that did
happen in 1796.
Thomas Jefferson ran as sort of
the southern representative, representing
kind of one
party em, emerging party.
John Adams represented the the other
emerging power
party, with more strength in, in the
north.
Adams was more of a federalist, and
Jefferson was an
emerging member of what would later be
called the Democratic Republican
party or the Republican party.
And they came in one and two respectively.
Remember, before that.
Basically, George Washington stood above
party, everyone voted for him, he was
unanimously elected President in the first
election, unanimously reelected in the
second election.
But when he exits the stage, the next tier
of revolutionary leaders
comes to the surface, Adams and Jefferson,
and they run against each other.
And they have different visions and they
come in one and two, respectively.
And they're not able to cooperate very
much because they actually represent
different philosophies, different
perspectives, different proto-parties.
And then A sitting President and Vice
President,
they run against each other in 1800, and
that
election was way more polarized than 1796
had been.
1796 was a little bit tense, but not Hyper
partisian
hyper polorized by 1800 the 2 men the
sitting president
and the vice president are running against
each other and
and and when you think about how
destabilizing that system is.
You begin to
see why the constitution is quickly
thereafter going to be amended.
Imagine, a world in which two people have,
have spent the last few months bashing
each other, each telling, his supporters
why the other fellow is a disaster.
imagine that.
The, the, the polity, the voters are
getting very energized
but also agitated and riled up and
polarized by these mass appeals,
these partisan appeals by party leaders.
And then imagine that, the election
results in both parties, sort of winning.
One party winning the, the, the top slot.
And the other party, winning the number
two slot.
Coming in number one and two in the race.
That is In effect, an assassination
incentive.
That's an impeachment incentive which is
kind
of waiting to have an accident, waiting to
happen.
A recipe for disaster because if something
happens to number
one Then number two succeeds and if they
represent very different
political visions and philosophies that's,
again, going to be an invitation for
partisan impeachments, for, again, maybe
even politically inspired assassinations.
It's a deeply destabilizing system.
And it's the
one the founders created because they
weren't imagining, I
think, the emergence of this strong two
party system.
And you might say well, boy they were dumb
why didn't they imagine that?
And I think the simple answer is The
two-party system
emerges only when, a national two-party
system, only when there's
a national office worth fighting for, and
there wasn't any
important national office worth organizing
around and fighting for under the
articles of the confederation.
Only when the Constitution's created when
you have
a strong Presidency does there become an
excuse, or
reason, an occasion for national
mobilization and the
creation of two national parties vying for
the Presidency.
And that is basically a product of the
Constitution itself, so They just didn't
anticipate the future but once, and so
to that extent yes the original
constitution really
wasn't safe for a 2 party system.
But after that Adams Jefferson rematch,
and
remember we're going to talk about the
picture.
This is a picture just to, to, to
anticipate.
Involving the signing and the drafting of
the Declaration of the
Independence and we have John Adams and
Thomas Jefferson in our
picture so we're going to come back to
Jefferson and Adams
at the end of the next lecture, but when
you had
these contests between Adams and Jefferson
and this political polarization and
especially after the second one, the
election of 1800-1801 The flaws of
the existing, of the founders' system in
the two party world,
an emerging two party world became
manifest, and the Constitution was
amended.
And in the 12th Amendment there
was provision made for separate election
for Presidents and Vice Presidents.
So now, actually you vote separately for
President and Vice President, which meant.
That presidential and vice-presidential
candidates could
run kind of as a tag team.
And it was easier to vote for
2 federalists for president and
vice-president respectively.
Or 2 democrat republicans for the office.
And this gives us the modern system.
And the 12th
amendment was designed to accommodate a 2
party system.
And in the very process by which it was
adopted.
It was adopted in a relatively partisan
way.
It was pushed by the Jeffersons, the
specific
rules they pushed forward advantaged their
party in particular.
It changed the electoral college in
various ways but kept in
place the bias toward the South created by
the Three Fifth's Clause.
Thomas Jefferson
with out that Three Fifth's Clause
actually loses in 1800.
John Adams would have one if the south
hadn't gotten extra votes.
Because of extra slaves created by the
Three Fifth's Clause.
And that was a big flaw of the electorial
college.
That wasn't fixed.
Other flaws were fixed and it was
basically the Jeffersonians who did the
fixing.
And they, they adopted an amendment that
very much sort of favored their political
interest.
So, so, partisanship was built into the
12th Amendment it self, how it was adopted
and the 12th Amendment is a reflection of
an emerging reality of a two party world.
And the story doesn't end there.
Let's look at some of the later
ammendments.
They very much are a product of a two
party system.
The 13th ammendment, abolishing slavery.
That's what the Republican platform
promised in 1864.
The Democrat party platform says, keep the
constitution as is.
But the Republicans won the re-election,
won the election.
Abe Lincoln is, is reelected.
And he uses his partisan
victory to twist some arms, and get, and
get a few Democrats on board.
That's what the movie Lincoln is all
about.
The two party system is the matrix in
which the 13th
Amendment is adopted, very much basically
Republicans with a handful of
Democrats, almost all of whom voted yes
only in the lame
duck period after they had been drubbed in
the General Election.
The 14th amendment,
even more partisan, every single Democrat
in Congress votes against it.
Every single Republican in Congress except
one votes for it.
It's a total party measure.
It is, in effect, the informal party,
Republican party platform
in 1866, that's an off-year election, it's
not a Presidential election.
But it is a partisan document from start
to finish, the, is
the 14th Amendment and so is the 15th,
which almost every Republican
votes for and almost every Democrat votes
against.
And this is a reminder that merely to say
something is partisan is not necessarily
to condemn it.
The 14th and the 15th amendments are the,
the crown jewels of our Constitution.
And they, they, are among America's most
shining accomplishments and they were
partisan measures.
Every bit as partisan an alignment, as for
example we saw in Obamacare.
So, the mere
fact that something is partisan doesn't
necessarily mean it's
right or wrong, it just a reminder that in
America.
The two parties have actually organized
American political sentiment.
And, and, there have been principled
disagreements
between the parties, in the past and
will continue, there will continue to be
disagreements, ideological and
philosophical in the future.
And that's not something That you should
condemn, it's, it's a deep feature of our,
unless you want to condemn the
whole constitutional system, it's, it's a
deep feature of our constitution now,
the, the repulican party had such
dominance in 1860 that it could
basically muster two-thirds in the house
And two-thirds in the Senate and
three-quarters
in the states, even without the support of
democrats, that was pretty unusual,
that was because the democrat party
kind of committed suicide because of
succession.
Later on, the later amendments are going
to be amendments basically where both
parties have had to agree in order to get
something through.
So let's take The later 16th amendment.
It too is organized by the parties, both
parties at the end, and
the 19 teens realize that there is this
emerging, progressive Movement
that basically is dissatisfied with in
income and wealth inequality.
And so both parties actually support
a 16th Amendment that's going to be about
a progressive income tax amendment.
It's supported by the Democratic Party and
by Republicans led by and it's in
their party platform, and Republicans from
Teddy
Roosevelt to William Howard Taft are on
board.
With this.
The nineteenth amendment, the women's
suffrage amendment, at
a certain point both parties realized that
women's
suffrage is probably going to happen.
If it's going to happen you don't want to
be the party resisting.
You don't want to be the last person in
the schoolhouse gates, so to speak,
resisting this reformation.
Because, whence women get the vote they're
going to punish.
People who op, who opposed women's
suffrage.
So, when the parties begin to see that
women's suffrage is one
day going to happen, it becomes a self
fulfilling prophecy and both parties
actually actively compete.
To support the amendment in order to
benefit from the newly enfranchised women.
So both the Republicans and Democratic
platforms support the idea
of woman suffrage.
In the middle of the twentieth century.
Blacks are the swing voters in America.
They had, before 1932 often supp...
Typically supported the Republicans, party
of Lincoln.
After 1972, they became more reliable
Democrats.
That's continues to be true today.
But between 1932 and 1972.
They're kind of, the swing constituency.
In the same way, that today, hispanics
are.
And in that period so,
in which Rose, Franklin Roosevelt, and
Harry
Truman, and John Kennedy, and Linden
Johnson are
trying to pry blacks away from their
loyalties
to the party of Lincoln, the Republican
party.
To join the Democrats and some Republicans
Are resisting,
and, trying to keep them in the party of
Lincoln.
In that period actually, there are a
series
of constitutional amendments that actually
benefit black Americans.
An amendment,
for example, about the District of
Columbia, and,
and treating it better in the Electoral
College system.
DC is a largely black jurisdiction.
Amendments about ending poll taxes and
giving young, poll
tax discrimination, disenfranchisement
because of failure to pay a poll tax.
An amendment that disproportionately helps
African Americans cause
they were disproportionately excluded by
poll tax disfranchisement.
An amendment allowing 18 year olds to
vote, young
adults between 18 and 21 were, were
disproportionately non-white.
So, these amendments, actually favored
African Americans, and they're
adopted at a time period where both
parties are
competing for the loyalty of, of African
Americans, and
so you see again the party system at work.
In fact, In some of the other specific
amendments, we see the influence
of the party system even more visibly.
17th Amendment, direct election of
Senators.
Well, as a practical matter, you had
direct election of Senators in
some states that were basically one party
states, dominated by one party.
And the Senate basically you know, whoever
won the.
Party nomination was going to win the
general election in
these one party states, the Democrat Party
in the South.
Some mid west states were overwhelmingly
Republican so whoever wins the party
nomination in those one party dominated
states is going to win the Senate seat
And parties, began to pick their nominees,
by primaries.
So those primaries are kind of direct
election of senators before the 17th
amendment.
The 17th amendment is codifying a kind of
emerging party practice.
that, that, 22nd Amendment means that, and
the
25th Amendment also kind of reflect
emerging party practices.
The 22nd Amendment is a two term
amendment.
It says that presidents actually can only
serve two terms.
What does that mean, that means that if
you can't serve a third term, you're
going to want to pick your wing man, pick
the person that in effect can serve
your third term.
That means that if you're Ronald Reagan
you can't serve three terms
but you can pick George HW Bush who can
serve out your
third term, and so the two term amendment
intensifies the kind of
Partnership and teamwork that you see as
early as the 12th Amendment.
Presidents and vice presidents running as
a tag team.
And the 22nd Amendment highlights that
and,
and creates reflects a world where presses
are
picking their successors.
Which is a reflection of what the parties
are beginning to do.
The parties in the 20th century are
beginning
to let presidential candidates pick their
running mates.
That wasn't true in earlier times.
Abe Lincoln didn't pick all of his, it, it
had to, his, his running mate and, and
that wasn't true for many of these party
conventions before the 1930s actually.
The parties
pick the two people, the top person, the
presidential candidates didn't handpick
the running mate, but beginning really in
the middle of the, the early
the mid third of the 20th century, this
has become an increasing
practice, and it's reflected in the 22nd
amendment, and also the 25th amendment.
The 25th amendment says, when the vice
presidency is
vacant, cause the vice president's
resigned or died, or the
President has died or resigned and the
Vice
President has moved up leaving a vacant
Vice Presidency.
When that happens, the President will get
to pick a successor,
I mean get to pick the Vice President
subject to Congressional confirmation.
That's.
A textual reflection in the formal written
constitution of this informal emerging
practice where
presidencial nominies are picking their
vice presidental running
mates subject to the broad approval of the
party.
convention.
So, so we see, in some of these more
modern amendments, reflections of the roll
of political parties.The political parties
are organizing the debate and sometimes.
The, the specific words of these
amendments are reflecting actually party
practices.
Like the primary
practice, which is direct election of
senators of a certain sort.
Like the practice of presidential
candidates
handpicking their running mates and
successors.
That 25th amendment is codification.
Of this party, um; uh; uh; practice.
So, so, um; and I'm going to tell you
about one more amendment today.
Um; which is the Poll Tax amendment, that
says no
disfranchisement um; in um; based on
failure to pay poll taxes
And that's true for federal elections
including quote primary elections.
So the text of this constitutional
amendment
itself is making a reference to primary
amendments,
primaries are organized by parties,
political parties are
now not just closely connected to the
constitutional
text but visible in the surface.
Of this Constitutional text.
The anti-discrimination rules about voting
are now applicable to primary
elections in which parties and governments
kind of coordinate to run
elections.
And and this is a reflection of the
fact that primaries are increasingly
important post-John Kennedy.
Before John Kennedy you could become
president
without running in primaries and Lyndon
Johnson
actually thinks even in 1960 he doesn't
need to enter any of the primaries.
He's just going to let the candidates in
the primary knock each other
out and he'll come into the convention and
scoop up all of the delegates.
But John Kennedy enters seven primaries
and wins
every one of them against different native
sons
Stuart Symington, Hubert Humphry, Scoop
Jackson and others, So
Kennedy shows in 1960 the power of primary
elections
and the text of the constitution is
reflecting that.
By now, in the 24th amendment saying we
are going to
have actually some, some rules that apply
to primary elections as such.
So just to conclude this lecture, the
original constitutions
really did not contemplate a two party
system, but many of the amendments have
emerged in reaction to, in contemplation
of Organized by and
reflective of a two party system.
Ours is.
It's baked into the cake.
It's built into various amendments.
and, in the next lecture I'm going to, try
to give you a Political Science
explanation of why once the two party
system, i- ah- rises.
It's pretty much an entrenched feature.
It's not going anywhere.
I want, now that we have it, we're very
unlikely to move away from it.
It would take the political equivalent of
an asteroid strike,
a massive asteroid strike, in order to, to
change the two
party system we have today and that's what
I'm going to explain in the next lecture.
So stay tuned.
