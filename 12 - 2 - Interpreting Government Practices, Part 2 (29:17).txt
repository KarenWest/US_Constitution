[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
So let's talk numbers.
How many persons are supposed to be in the
House of Representatives, or the Senate,
or the Supreme Court?
Well if we look at the written
constitution we say two Senators for each
State.
That's pretty cut and dry.
But if we look at the written constitution
it
doesn't really specify how big the Supreme
Court should be.
Or how big the House of Representatives
should be.
At least,
there's a very wide range for the House of
Representatives that
the text says, you have to have one
representative for each state.
So, that means you can have you know, as
few as, as 50.
Or and the text also sets a limit.
But that limit actually to, it would,
given today's population you could have
5,000.
And yet, actually we don't have a house
of representatives of 50, that's kind of
unimaginable.
And we don't have a house of
representatives
of 5,000, I think that's also
unimaginable.
And the unwritten Constitution actually
narrows considerably
the range that the written Constitution
permits.
I think the unwritten Constitution really
says Gee, the, the House of
Representatives?
That's supposed to be the people's branch.
It's supposed to be closer to people.
It's supposed to be the most numerous
branch of the, the Congress.
And so it would be pretty weird
to have fewer representatives and
Senators.
You gotta have two Senators from each
state on average.
You gotta have you have tw-, you have two
Senators from each state in total, so 100.
So it would be very weird to have a House
of Representatives that were ever smaller.
Than the Senate.
And so from the very beginning actually
the House of Representatives after the
first census was bigger than it had to be
because actually the critics
of the Constitution worried that the House
was too small.
It was going to be unrepresentative, only
a few
great men with great reputations were
going to get elected.
And so, actually, the Federalists
promised, even during
the ratification prob-, pro-, process,
don't worry, we're
going to actually make the, the, the House
of
Representatives as big as the, as the text
allows.
We're going to, basically as soon as the
first census occurs, we're going to
have a House of a 100 members, the
original House until that first
census, was 65 members.
But the framers of the constitution, the
Federalists, said don't worry
when we have a census we'll pump it up to
a 100.
And, we'll keep increasing it until it
gets to you know, somewhere around 200,
and, only then will we begin to, to think
about leveling off or something.
And they were true to their word.
That, that promise that they made in the
ratification process, was part of an
unwritten constitution.
The promise was that the House of
Representatives would
start after the first census at 100, and
keep growing at a substantial cliff and it
did.
And there's some structural reasons why
that makes sense.
Once the House has a certain number, let's
say 150, it's not going to
be And when there's a new census, and
census happens every ten years, it's
not going to be in the interest of, of
most House members to try to
shrink it down because that would mean
some of them are kind of guaranteed.
To, to not to be in the next
house so, so it kind of just functions as
a rackshift.
it, it hasn't really ever dramatically
decreased in size.
I think there was one period where it
dipped a little bit but.
But basically it, it increased until it
got pretty
big, 435, and at that point basically
early in
the 20th century I think the thought was,
gee,
it can't keep growing infinitely, so maybe
this is sort
of a good size, and so by statute Not
by constitutional provision, but by
statute the house is 435.
So, way bigger than the 50 that would be
permissible, way smaller than the 5,000
would be permissible.
But you can see how the system itself
creates kind of certain incentives.
For congress people to listen to
constituents.
Constituents wanted something bigger than
one representative
per state.
but, you don't want it so big that they
can't even talk to each other and, and
deliberate.
So that's the house.
Remember, the Senate's easy.
The text is clear, two senators per state.
What about the judiciary?
Well, we now have nine people on the
Supreme Court.
But we've had as few as five.
At the founding it was six.
It went down to five at one point.
It's gone up to as many
as ten.
And, and so that's not fixed by the text
of the Constitution.
Our tradition has been nine ever since
the, you know, for, for the 20th century,
throughout the 20th century.
Franklin Roosevelt very famously tried to
change the
number in his court packing plan in 1937.
He wanted to increase the number to 15 and
his critics said, you only
want to do that because you're not winning
among the nine who are there.
And you're just trying to pack the court
to, to get
a bunch of new justices who will agree
with your position.
So, congress actually rejected Roosevelt's
plan.
But the rejection that plan did
not create some unwritten constitutional
principle that
it has to be nine, because the text pretty
clearly says Congress gets
to decide the size, and Congress hasn't
chosen to exercise that power, but
mere non-use of the power doesn't mean
that somehow the text is amended.
The text still gives Congress this power.
It hasn't used it in the last You know, 70
years but, it perhaps
could in the future, just like there were
periods of time where Congress never
passed a civil rights law, large, you
know, half a century, but it didn't
thereby lose its power to pass a later
civil rights law or voting rights law.
So where the text is pretty clear, and I
think on the Supreme Court, the
text is pretty clear, the Congress
actually
does get to By statute determine the size.
And it has done that over time.
Remember as few as five.
As many as ten.
Maybe it has to do, to change the size
for a kind of a good government reason
perhaps.
Rather than for, for some mere partisan
advantage.
Maybe not.
That's kind of a, a, a debateable realm.
What, what reasons might congress have for
changing or modifying.
Or manipulating the size of the court.
But I think there's pretty widespread
agreement that, if congress had a good
government reason for modifying
the size of the supreme court, it could do
so because
the written constitution's pretty clear,
and the unwritten constitution merely says
it hasn't done so recently but it did
earlier in American history.
Okay.
So how about the rule the, the the
internal voting rules
within the House, the Senate, the
Judiciary?
Government entities, you know, we've been
talking about how
government is constituted, how these
organs of power actually operate.
That's the kind of Constitutional law
we're, we're examining right now.
How the government is constituted.
Some a government entity it can't do
anything at all with the kind of sort
of voting rules determining what counts as
a decision for or against a certain
proposition.
And here's the kick in the head.
The constitution doesn't explicitly
specify these internal voting rules.
They're often implicit, they're part of an
unwritten constitution.
So the supreme court's now nine.
Where does it say
that if its five to four the five win?
It doesn't say so in so many words but
that's been clear from the beginning that
majority rule is just presupposed and the
House of Representatives has always used.
Majority rule that actually the Senate did
early on.
And that's because the framers believed
that majority rule
was just the the basic baseline and
premise of
a system.
It's the, the natural law of every
assembly, unless.
It's otherwise specified said Jefferson,
said Franklin, thought all the founders.
And so you might say, wait a minute
professor,
what about this filibuster, thing that
I've heard about.
So, let's actually talk about the
filibuster.
Let's use actually the framework we've
developed to
think about the filibuster, because
there's some folks today.
That think that Senate actually
can't do anything unless 60 Senators out
of 100 say so and that the
Senate can't even change that filibuster
rule unless 60 or more Senators vote
to change the filibuster rule, kind of a
catch 22, actually, that it requires
60 votes to pass all sorts of bills
according to a certain Senate rule.
Senate Rule 22 and according to some you
know, you
can't really change Senate Rule 22 without
a 60 vote
super majority and if so, Rule 22 would be
catch 22.
and, an intention with the deep majority
principles that every other institution
abides by.
So let's, let's take a step back and look
at Senate rule 22, the filibuster rule.
Using the framework we've de, been
developing.
So, let's first think about the implicit
constitution.
Now the constitution
says pretty clearly that when a president
vetoes a bill, 2 3rds
of the house and two-thirds of the senate
suffice to override the veto.
So obviously Something less than 2 3rds,
should be required to, to pass an ordinary
bill, and, and by tradition and principle,
I'll give you some more reasons.
That something less is,
simple majority rule.
Well let me put it another way.
If Senate Rule 22 can entrench A 60 vote
rule, why
couldn't it entrench a 70 vote rule, or an
80 vote rule?
But those rules would clearly be
inconsistent with the clear text
of the Veto Clause, that says 2 3rds is
enough to override.
You can't have an entrenched 70 vote rule.
You can't have an entrenched 80 vote rule.
And, and maybe actually they have the idea
you
can't have any entrenched rule other than
majority rule.
The Constitution presupposes majority
rule.
So it take, the reason that
constitutional amendment requires 2 3rds
is that
constitutional amendment should be harder
than ordinary statutes.
The reason that the constitution specifies
a super majority
rule to expel a member of congress is the
baseline.
Is majority rule.
Wherever the constitution, all these
specific voting rules
in the constitution exist against an
implicit baseline.
Where, where nothing is specified,
majority rule is the premise.
Now let's look at America's enacted
constitution.
Remember how does the constituion come
about?
By state ratifying conventions.
How did those state ratifying conventions
vote for the Constitution?
By simple majority rule.
In New York, it was 30 to 27.
And everyone understood when that vote was
taken that 30 beat the
27, and everyone understood that even
though the text doesn't say that
at all.
You won't find that in article seven, you
won't find that in the preamble.
But, everyone understood that majority
rule is the basic rule of all branches
of, of, of government, unless there's
something specified to the contrary, okay,
so.
Remember, early chapters we looked at
implicit constitution, chapter one the
inactive
constitution, chapter two, America's lived
constitution,
how ordinary do people live their
lives, but you're members of all sorts of
clubs, and ordinarily in clubs,
and stamp clubs and chess clubs and, and
PTAs and all the rest.
Unless you have your by-laws specify
otherwise majority rule is the basic
principle.
Not what about America's doctrinal
constitution.
What does case law say?
Actually case law says majority rule.
A very important supreme case called
United States versus Ballin proclaimed
this is a quote, the general rule of all
parliamentary bodies
is that where a quorum is present the act
of
the majority of the quorum is the act of
the body.
This has been the rule for all time.
Except so far, as in any given case, the
terms of the
organic act, under which the body
is assembled, have prescribed specific
limitations.
No such limitation is found in the federal
constitution,
and therefore the general law of such
bodies obtains.
Unless the constitution specifies
otherwise,
it's majority rule, says the Supreme
Court.
America's symbolic constitution, well some
of our greatest icons of
a of, of, of America like the voting
rights act.
You know, they were passed really despite
the filibuster.
The filibuster was actually used against
some of these things
and Now, remember we were talking about
Americas institutional constitution and.
Here's where history comes in.
The first Senate, acted by majority rule.
The very first Senate, remember they have
kind of jump starting question a
little like what happened in Congress in
the 1860s during the civil war.
By what rule is the first Senate
going to organize itself and pass rules of
procedure?
You know, by what rules is it going to
decide what the rules of procedure are?
and, it decided by majority rule.
And what's true for the first Senate is
true for all other Senates.
And in fact, prior to the Civil War, there
was no, important measure where
a mino, minority actually ever sort of
thwarted the majority from expressing its,
its will.
No example of anything like today's
filibuster
for the entire period before the Civil
War.
And you know this actually.
You may not know you know it, but you
do because you took American history in
high school.
And you remember, for example, the
compromise of 1850.
Oh what a big deal that was, and it was a
big
deal because California came in to the
union as a free state.
Without an offsetting slave-state.
And now, for the first time, the free
states
have a, just a bare simple majority in the
Senate.
And that was a big deal,
precisely because bare majorities actually
governed in
the Senate for the entire Antebellum
Period.
Or I can put it another way.
If there's some example of the filibuster
before the Civil War of any important
sort.
Name it.
You know, I've, I've never heard of, of,
of
one and you haven't either and even rule
22,
which is a very, a much later development,
when
you read it carefully, it doesn't say that
it
can't be repealed by simple majority rule.
It actually
says the debate on it can't end on it
until you get to 60.
And and so here's actually what's called
the nuclear option.
Republicans used to support it When they
come
ba, now Dem, some Democrats are pushing
it.
And when the Republicans come back in
power they, they in the Senate,
they may push it again.
It's also called the Constitutional
Option.
And what it says is, by simple majority
vote, if the majority's very determined it
basically can get rid it can end debate
on filibuster reform after everyone has
been heard.
You have to let everyone, sort of say
their piece.
But after everyone has genuinely been
heard.
A simple majority of the Senate can get
rid of Rule 22 because the constitution
itself guarantees their right to do so and
Rule
22 in fact, carefully read, doesn't
purport to say otherwise.
That's the so called nuclear option or
constitutional option and it shows.
The great power of the, the framework
we've been developing here.
By paying attention to the tools and
techniques of America's
implicit constitution and America's
inactive
constitution and America's doctrinal
constitution.
We can actually and, paying attention to
actual institutional practice we come up
with a very arresting conclusion very
significant that any
day, not just the first day of the Senate.
The Senate is a continuing body.
Every day is the same as every other day.
The House of Representatives comes to
life, springs
to life, a new one, every two years.
It's not a continuous, continuing body.
But the Senate is.
Every day is like the day before, they
can, they can follow the rules that
they've inherited
from the day before, but every day by
simple majority vote if they're
determining every, any day.
They can change those rules.
Now they shouldn't do so, only
deliberately and letting people actually
speak out
if they have an objection, but once
everyone has been heard, we vote.
Minorities get to speak.
And majorities get to
vote and rule.
That's the basic thought.
and, so stay tuned.
You're going to hear more about filibuster
reform in the years ahead.
I'm going to conclude now.
With four case studies,
that illustrate this general proposition.
Here's the general
proposition.
Where the constitution is clear Various
innovations that run counter to it
basically
don't survive in the long run, they fail.
You know, they're all sorts of interesting
ideas that
people have, and sometimes they're good
and sometimes they're
bad, if these innovations and ideas
basically can fit
within the, the, the broad contours of the
text.
If the text can be read to accommodate
them the, the, the,
these new the, these adaptations survive.
But if they go beyond.
If they, if they break the text, they
basically actually fail in the long run.
So in the long run actually,
America's written and unwritten
constitution fit together.
I'll give you four examples of kind of new
ideas, two
of which basically, weren't in sync with
the constitution and failed.
Two of which were clever adaptations that.
Could be read to align with the written
constitution.
And they suceeded.
So here's one failure.
It's called a legislative veto.
And here's how it worked.
Congress would pass a law at time T1 and
the law might say something like,
you know, if you do A, B, and C you get
some special benefit, X.
Some tax credit or something.
Unless, one house
of congress decides otherwise, later on at
time T2, and then you don't get x.
So if either house of congress or both
houses of congress acted together on
something, or
without the Presidents signature, or some
committee later
vetoes the benefit, you don't get the
benefit.
That's called a legislative veto.
And when, and it was when in a whole bunch
of statutes beginning
in the, in the 20th century, and when that
issue reached the Supreme Court,
the Supreme Court laughed it out of court,
and rightly so because it's
kind of constitutionally preposterous even
though the
label, legislative veto, no the veto is
for the presidency, and legislatures are
supposed to legislate but they're not
supposed
to do, through, so, with a thing called a
veto, two simple, logical proofs.
What are you doing at, at time T2, when
you purport to veto this thing.
Either you're saying, well actually,
this person didn't really meet criteria a,
b,
and c, so he's not eligible for benefit x.
If that's what you're doing, that's
not legislating, that's adjudicating and
judging.
That's determining whether factual
conditions A, B, and C actually exist.
That's for the executive to do in the
first instance,
and, if someone's dissatisfied, for a
judge to decide afterwards.
That's applying your earlier law to the
facts.
Well your saying, this person doesn't
deserve x,
because they don't really qualify for the
earlier
standard, A, B and C, that we laid down.
Not your call legislature.
That's up to executives in the first
instance and judges who apply law to
facts.
Okay.
Alternatively you could say oh that's not
what we're doing.
We just decided that A, B and C shouldn't
be the standard.
It should be D, E, and F.
Fine, then pass a new law.
But that law would require bicameralism
and presentment
to the Presidency.
So.
The two formal proofs, first, you know.
If what you're doing in this
legislative veto is actually deciding that
the person didn't, wasn't
eligible, that's not legislation and you
cant do it, that's adjudication.
And outside of a few special occasions
like impeachment.
Judging the qualification of your own
members.
You and Congress are not supposed to be
judges.
You're supposed to be law makers.
Alternatively your'e saying the person
didn't really
you know we want to change the standards.
And if you're trying to change the
standards pass a new law.
Put differently, that's one proof.
Here's a different proof, but either way
it's unconstitutional.
Here's a differnet proof.
What is the legislative veto?
It's got to be either executive,
legislative,
or judicial, those are the only three
powers in the constitution, and the tenth
amendment says there are no other powers.
If its legislative, it requires both
houses
by cameralism and presentment to the
president.
The president gets to veto it or not.
So if its legislative, you're not doing it
the right way.
If it's executive or judicial, generally
you in congress don't have that power.
Outside impeachment and these few other
exemptions.
So when it reached the court, the court
laughed
it out of of court, the Supreme Court did.
Presidents throughout the 20th century,
every single
one of them basically said the legislative
veto was unconstitutional.
It doesn't go back to the George
Washington era,
to the founding era, so this was an
adaptation,
an innovation an invention And it failed
because it
doesn't really fit the constitution's
basic separation of power structure.
How bout the Independent Counsels, Ken
Starr and others that we had
post-Watergate.
Well we need to deal with executive
law breaking, but the independent counsel
model
didn't quite work because judges were
picking prosecutors.
And that's.
Just not how our system is designed to
operate.
And how could the independent counsel be
genuinely independent,
and also inferior because judges can only
appoint inferior officers,
inferior basically meant inferior to
judges, magistrates, bailiffs, court
clerks.
It didn't mean, you know, picking people
who can prosecute or investigate the
president himself.
so, so the independent council statute was
well-intentioned.
But it really didn't fit the basic
constitutional structure.
It gave non judicial, improper non
judicial powers to judges it, it,
it, it created someone who was
supposed to be simultaneously independent
and inferior.
Which is a weird thing, just like
legislative veto is
a contradiction terms inferior and
independent, that's that's a weird
combination, and the system basically
failed and it failed because
presidents came to recognize that the
system was a constitutional monstrosity.
And they refused to reauthorize it.
The legislative veto statute was just a
temporary experiment, it
lapsed every few years and after a certain
point president said
we're not going to support this, and these
were Republican presidents
as well as Democrat presidents who
eventually came to that position.
Bill Clinton alongside George HW Bush for
example.
Just as presidents of all stripes,
republican and democratic,
had come to see the legislative veto was
unconstitutional.
So those things went beyond the text of
the constitution, and they failed.
I'll give you two clever innovations,
adaptations, that are
within the text of the constitution, and,
and have survived.
One that is really weird this is called a
Saxbe fix.
In a nut shell, here is what the Saxbe fix
is.
There's the provision
of the constitution that says, if you're a
senator or a representative, you are not
eligible to
serve in some executive or judicial
position whose salary
has increased while you the senate of the
house.
Okay?
So the idea is you can't pump up the
salaries of these existing positions
and then basically take the, the inflated
salary position as kind of an
anti-bribery, anti-corruption
idea.
You don't want to let the president give
you some sinecure, some cushy job
and, to reward you for going
along with president's program elsewhere
or something.
Okay.
But what about,
So these cost of living increases, that we
have for cabinet officers, or something.
What if you say fine The salary was
increased, but I won't take the increase.
I'll just take the earlier salary.
And that sort of fits the spirit of the
provision or it shouldn't
be forever ineligible just because we have
cost of living increase on my watch.
As long as they take the lower salary
haven't I really
complied with the spirit of the provision.
And a thing called the Saxebe Fix is a
way of taking the position without the
salary increase.
And it's been done with the blessing of
Republican as
well as Democrat congresses and Republican
as well as Democrat Presidents.
It's the provision, it's the little
wrinkle
under which Hilary Clinton left the Senate
and
became Secretary of State because
Secretary of State, the salary
actually increased on her watch but she
didn't take the increase.
Ken Salazar, that was true of, but it's,
it's been true.
Republican presidents have also used the
Saxbe Fix going all the way
back to, to Ulysses S Grant, and, and
Taft, and and others.
And, and so, so that's an adaptation that
doesn't really violate the,
the, the letter and spirit of the
Constition, which have
some ambiguities in them, and Give you one
final example.
Independent agencies.
Independent agencies, are basically picked
by the president that the
members of them but they can't be fired at
will.
Like the head of the fed, or the
other members of the federal reserve
system, for example.
That is a deep part of our constitutional
system.
How the consti-, gu-, the government has
actually constituted.
But it doesn't run afoul of the, the
rules.
Speci-, presidents are picking these
people.
Presidents are are the ones who remove
them.
They don't get to remove them at will, but
only for cause.
But the constitution doesn't say, have
elaborate rules on, on, on removal.
It has rules on appointment and to repeat,
Presidents appoint all these people.
There have been times
when Congress has tried to pass statutes
vesting appointment powers in Congress
itself, and the Supreme Court has laughed
those laws out of court.
Because that does violate the written
Constitution for the House
or the Senate or some leaders thereof to
appoint government officials.
But as long as the President's doing the
appointing.
And the president's doing the firing
whether the firing is for cause or or more
generally at will.
The Constitution permits both of these
systems.
Here's one final way of putting the point.
Independent agencies have been around for
a very long time.
Presidents of all parties have supported
them.
They didn't support the legislative veto.
They didn't support the independent
counsel.
But the have supported the Saxbe Fix and
independent agencies.
So the basic idea, in a nutshell, and here
I'm going to conclude and
I'll, with one, final thought about this
fellow over here.
Where the written constitution is
ambiguous, and
these informal adaptations kind of fit can
be,
can be read to simply clarify an ambiguity
or fill a gap in the constitution.
And where all branches of government have
pretty much agreed, and
especially where something goes all the
way back to the founding
this practice, then it's pretty easy.
But, when these innovations really are
inconsistent with clearly the letter
and spirit of the constitution, and they
don't have deep constitutional roots
all the way to the founding, and they
haven't been embraced by
both parties and all branches of
government, then actually they don't
survive.
America's writen, unwritten constitution
fit together to form a single system.
America's unwritten Constitution lives
in its written Constitution, and its
written Constitution lives in its
unwritten Constitution.
Now who's this fellow?
He's the last recess appointment to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
President Eisenhower appointed Potter
Stewart during
a Senate recess to the Supreme Court.
And since then, presidents have appointed
judges to
lower federal courts, but not to the
Supreme Court.
But Potter Stewart is one of a long line.
Of recess appointees who,
who proves that even for the judiciary,
you can
have this, and the text is ambiguous on
this.
And I confess I wanted to share with you
this picture in particular.
This was he was appointed to the court
in the late' 50s by President Eisenhower,
but I
wanted to share this with you because this
is
a Yale MOOC, a Yale Massive Open Online
Course.
I went to Yale, I, I teach at Yale and I
went to Yale College.
And Yale Law School, and Potter Stewart
went to Yale College and Yale Law School,
so it's my
little way of just reminding you that this
is a Yale MOOC.
I hope you've been enjoying it so far.
We're not done yet, so stay tuned.
