Welcome back.
Well, we've covered the preamble, how the
Constitution was ordained and established.
Articles one,two and three, the
Legislative, Executive and Judicial
powers.
Article four, Federalism.
The relationship among the states
horizontally,
and the related powers of Congress to
sort of monitor states for basic
compliance with foundational principles of
Republican Government.
And the related power
of Congress to, to regulate the
territories in
such a way as to eventually, make them
into proper republican states that will be
admitted,
as new states on equal footing with the
old.
We've talked about Article five.
The provision of the Constitution setting
forth how it's to be amended.
Then you might say okay, well, what's
left?
We've kind of covered everything.
Not quite, Articles six and seven, both of
which are quite short, remain to be
discussed.
Article six is going to be an elaboration
of the supremacy
of the Constitution, its status as supreme
law of the land.
And Article seven is going to give us a
little more specificity
about how this ordainment and
establishment process is actually going to
work.
What, what do you mean, we the people of
the United States do ordain and establish
this Constitution?
You know, who's the people,
how, how do we cash that out concretely,
you know,
how united are the states going to be
coming into this thing?
How, how's all that going to work?
So first, Article six.
Article six is, a provision of the
Constitution, conventionally,
referred to just as the shorthand, the
Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.
It establishes that the Constitution is
the supreme law of the land.
Not withstanding anything, in, any state
constitution or state law.
It's supreme over federal statues, it's
supreme over federal treaties,
it's supreme over all forms of, of state
law, state
constitution law, state statutory law,
judge made law, and in fact judges both
of the Federal government and of the
states
are oath bound to treat the constitution
as supreme law
of the land as are other officials, state
and federal.
The President, the Legislative, the
Congress, Cabinet officers,
state, Executive and, and Legislative
officers.
So, this is the supreme law of the land
that every official really state and
federal, is oath-bound
to recognize as such.
Now, a few things about that.
One, the Articles of Confederation said
nothing of the sort.
They never describe themselves as law,
much less supreme law, much less
supreme law that state judges had to
respect even over state constitutions.
And in fact, they, the articles didn't
even say
that anything that, the things that
Congress did were laws.
Didn't describe the old congress
as a legislature.
Did use the words law and legislature, but
only referring to state laws and state
legislatures.
And so state courts under the Articles of
Confederation really treated the articles
as basically no more than a treaty.
And the rule of treaties, was that
they could be superseded by later statues
and so state courts sometimes basically
allowed state statutes to pretty much,
that were passed
after the articles to an effect deviate
from the articles.
The Constitution says none of that
anymore.
The Constitution is supreme law and it's
supreme over
all forms of state law and state judges,
among others,
are oath bound to treat it as such and
the point here is not just the
Constitution says this,
you know?
Anyone can just say it, but ,um, today in
America everyone respects that.
People actually don't go around saying,
well an ordinary statute
can repeal the Constitution or judges can
make stuff up openly,
can actually, judges can openly proclaim
that the real supreme
law is what they say rather than what the
Constitution says.
You might think judges have misconstrued
the
Constitution, but they all purport to be
applying
the written Constitution as do state
officials.
and, and, and so, sociologically as well
as formally, the
Constitution really is the supreme law of
our land that,
that people take oaths to and, and as a
general
proposition take quite seriously, both
ordinary citizens and government
officials.
Now the question is why is it the supreme
law of the land?
Okay.
It says so?
Professor.
And okay, everyone seems to accept that
today.
Wasn't quite true in the 1860s, with the
Civil
War, but today, they seem to acess, accept
this.
Well, why?
Why should it be the supreme law of the
land?
Why should stuff that happened 200 years
ago be more important than the
statute adopted tomorrow by the House and
the Senate and signed by the President?
Isn't that, that statue today, and the
here, and
adopted today in the here, and now, why
should
that be the supreme law of the land
trumping something that
a bunch of old white dead guys agree to
200 years ago.
And I think the answer is that the
Constitution is the supreme law of the
land
because actually in a, in, a, in some
very real ways, it's got a deeper
democratic foundation.
It's higher because it's, it's deeper.
It comes from the people themselves.
Remember, at the time
of the Constitution the people who, in
fact,
might not be eligible to vote for state
legislatures, might not be eligible to
vote for
Congress, got to vote on the Constitution
itself.
And a process that involved a whole year
of ordinary people talking
to each other about how they and their
posterity would be governed.
This sort of doesn't happen when ordinary
laws are, are being passed.
The latest tariff bill or a tweak of the
anti-trust laws or
budget, or, or what have you.
So the Constitution is the supreme law of
the land because it comes from the people.
It's higher law because has a more
democratic foundation.
And amendments trump ordinary statutes
because it was much harder to adopt them.
They, a much broader democratic consensus.
That's Article V.
Two thirds of the house have to agree on
the statute, on the,
on the Constitutional amendment, two
thirds of
the Senate and then three quarters of
the states.
So if it's hard to get an amendment
adopted, two thirds,
two thirds, three quarters, it should be
equally hard to repeal that.
It should take another two thirds, two
thirds, three quarters to
undo what that special two thirds, two
thirds, three quarters have done.
So, amendments should trump ordinary
statutes because an
ordinary statute just means you know, half
of
the House, half of the Senate and, and
the President and the states don't even
weigh in.
So ordinary statute doesn't have the
same democratic pedigree as the
Constitution itself.
Or its amendments.
Now once you understand that basically the
supremacy clause has kind
of a democratic gradient to it, you can
see why the
constitution and trumps a statute, so only
statutes, Congressional statutes passed
in pursuance of, consistent with the
Constitution are the supreme law.
You can understand why
it should trump an ordinary treaty.
A treaty shouldn't be able to change the
Constitution.
Two thirds of the Senate, you know, with
the President on their side
shouldn't be able to modify, but two
thirds of the House, two thirds
of the Senate and three quarters of the
states had agreed to so
the Constitution should trump a statute,
should
trump a treaty, should trump state
constitutions.
because only, that's only involving one
state rather than we the people
of the United States as a whole, should
trump a state statute.
A fortiori, that's a Latin phrase meaning
"even more strongly".
The US Constitution says it's the supreme
level.
And not withstanding anything to the
contrary in the state constitution.
Well it also goes on to say not
withstanding anything to the contrary in
the state statute.
For the same basic reasons.
A fortiori, state statute is lower than a
state constitution.
So when some people sometimes ask me,
well wasn't the, didn't the secessionists
have a leg to
stand on in the 1860s, where does the
Constitution prohibit secession.
I say, "what part of the Supremacy Clause
do you not understand?"
I have kids, sometimes I look at them and
I
say, "what part of no did you not
understand here?"
So the Supremacy Clause says the
Constitution is the Supreme
Law of the Land notwithstanding anything
that a state does.
So once you're in, you're in.
And the
Supremacy Clause makes that clear.
And
it, it's going to turn out Article VII,
that you don't have to join the thing.
That Article VII is going to explain that
if you don't vote for the
Constitution you're in, in New York,
you're not bound by it in New York.
Or if you don't vote with the constitution
in, if Rhode
Island doesn't say yes, Rhode Island's not
going to be bound by it.
But once Rhode Island says yes, once
you're in, you're in.
And we'll talk a little bit more about
that when we get to Article VII.
One more feature of Article VI that
I wanted to highlight for you is okay, the
Constitution is
the highest law because it's the most
democratic along with its amendments.
Then comes federal statutes that are in
conformity with the Constitution.
because, they're passed by a continental
body, and not quite as democratically
participatory
as the amendment process, as the
ordainment and establishment process, but
next best,
later on, are, the, are the supremacy
clauses.
State constitutions and state statutes
are, are later.
But it also talks about federal treaties,
and treaties are below the
Constitution and they're above state
constitutions
because treaties involve all the United
States.
But what's the relationship between
federal treaties and federal statutes?
Now courts have basically said treaties
and
statutes are both below the US
Constitution and
above state constitutions and state law,
but they're on the same level.
So basically, we, the courts have said,
the last in time rule applies.
If you got two statutes and they conflict.
Which statute do you go with?
The more recent one because they're on the
same level, and if
they're on the same level, you go with the
more recent one.
But if something's on a higher level, it
trumps, even if it's older.
The Constitution, even if we're talking
about a 14th Amendment adopted 150
years ago, it trumps a statute tomorrow
that's
inconsistent with it because it's on a
higher level.
But, as between one constitutional
amendment and another
constitutional amendment, it's the the
later amendment that governs.
So we repealed prohibition.
As between two statutes, because they're
on the
same level, it's the later statute that
trumps.
As between two treaties, it's the later
treaty that prevails.
And so, the argument the courts have
adopted is, well,
treaties and statutes are pretty much are
on the same level,
so statutes can repeal treaties and
treaties
can repeal statutes, which ever is more
recent.
But I think if you look more carefully at
the
Constitution, it says the Constitution,
statutes, and treaties, in that order.
Statutes are higher than treaties and
they're
higher than treaties, they're higher than
treaties.
They come, they're mentioned first because
they are more
democratically accountable because you
have
the House of Representatives involved.
And so although this is not what courts
have said,
it closely tracks what courts in general
have in fact done,
which is understand that there is certain
things that actually treaties can't do.
Here are some things that you shouldn't be
allowed to do by a mere treaty.
Shouldn't be allowed to raise an army by a
mere treaty.
Only the, the House of Representatives,
needs to be, I think, involved in that.
And that's why the army lapses every two
years, and that's tied
to elections for the House of
Representatives every two years.
An ordinary treaty shouldn't be allowed to
create a new federal crime.
Only Congress should be allowed to with
the House of Representatives.
To create a new crime or to raise an
internal task or to declare a war.
There's certain things structurally that
you need the House of Representatives
to be involved in and I think the same is
true if you're going to
repeal a statute, a statute that was
adopted with the House of Representatives'
participation.
You shouldn't be allowed to do that by a
mere treaty.
A treaty can say we promise, we will
repeal some pre-existing statute, but then
Congress needs to repeal that statute and
the House of Representatives needs to get
involved.
In technical law talk, certain sorts of
treaties cannot be self-executing.
They require subsequent congressional
legislation.
So for example, when Thomas Jefferson
tells
Napoleon, we're going to buy Louisiana
from you
and the Senate says, yes, we are, great,
but who's going to pay for that?
Need the House of Representatives to be
involved in a bill
that spends a dime, or raises an internal
tax, or creates
a new federal crime, or raises an army, or
declares a war.
And I think symmetrically, by similar
structural logic
the, the House of Representatives needs to
be
involved if a, if a statute is to be, a
Federal statute is to be repealed.
So treaties should trump state statutes
and
state constitutions, because treaties
represent the United States.
But treaties aren't really at the same
level as statutes.
So I say, the Constitution, laws, and
treaties, in that order, for democratic
reasons.
And by the way, that's the order in the
supremacy clause itself, if you look at it
carefully.
Okay.
So, the supreme law of the land.
And it's the law of the land.
The entirety of the United States,
including its territories, including any
state.
Once a state is in, it's in, it's part of
the land.
If you don't
like it, you're always free to leave, but
you don't
get to take the land with you, the water
with you.
All Americans, basically fought to defend
Charleston Harbor in
the War of 1812 and so the people in
Charleston
don't unilaterally ever get to turn those
guns around
and point them into the bellies of their
fellow Americans.
All Americans fought for New Orleans in
the War
of 1812 and kind of the revolutionary war
part
two, the entire continent basically helps
defend
that for good geostrategic and national
security reasons.
The people in New Orleans shouldn't be
allowed
just unilaterally to turn those guns the
other way.
Andy Jackson understood that, he stared
down those South Carolinians when he
was president, he was born in South
Carolina, but he stared them down.
He understands the importance of New
Orleans
he's the, the, victor of the battle of
New Orleans and so for very sound
geostrategic reasons the
Constitution says, we, this is the supreme
law of the land.
Notwithstanding anything in any state
constitution, any state law.
A state on its own can't take itself out
of the union.
The supremacy clause is pretty emphatic
about that, so listen up Rick Perry.
And as we've talked about in our first
lectures, people adopting
the Constitution in the Preamble knew
that.
No Federalists ever said," gee, why don't
you vote for the
thing, and if you don't like it you can
always leave."
Instead, the Federalists insist that
they're creating
a more perfect union for geostrategic
reasons.
And that takes us to Article seven.
Because Article seven is going to cash out
the Preamble.
The Preamble talks about," We the people
of the
United States ordaining and establishing
this Constitution."
Article seven talks about how this
Constitution, same
words, are, is to be, you know,
established.
Same, same word as the Preamble.
Preamble's the first sentence of the
Constitution, Article seven is the last
sentence o o of the original Constitution.
So one sentence to begin, one sentence to
end.
They're kind of matching bookend, sort of.
If its a building, sort of the front porch
and the rear portico.
They, they perfectly match, again sentence
a piece.
And Article seven tells us how, we the
people
of the United States are actually going to
do this.
So first what do you mean people?
Article seven says here's what we mean by
people, special conventions
are going to be the ones deciding, whether
to ratify or not.
Not ordinary legislatures but special
conventions.
It doesn't spell out all the rules about
how these conventions are to
be, selected, but the idea is they should
really
be representative of the people in a very
special way.
And then, in the different states, rules
emerged to, to sort of
implement that idea, that these are
supposed to be conventions of the people.
You might say, well why not just have a
referendum?
And I think the simplest answer is,
because the referendum really hadn't been
invented yet.
The Swiss hadn't done it yet on on a kind
of national level.
And,
and so the idea of, of voting for
individuals for representatives was
well established, but not quite the idea
of voting on ordinary laws.
California doesn't exist yet.
And then, so we don't have the
California-style, the western-style,
referendum, that's going to be a later
part of our story.
And part of the reason it doesn't exist
is' because the idea is when
you're voting for laws, you actually have
to discuss them and deliberate among them.
You can't just vote.
You have to sort of
talk first and, and how is that going to
happen on a state level?
Maybe it could happen in New England
because you have town meetings.
And in New England people go actually in
individual towns and they talk about
something once.
There's some proposal, and then they meet
again a second time, and then a third
time, and only after everyone has talked
about it, do they vote on the proposal.
But the South doesn't town, actually
townships that way.
Doesn't have a structure for people to
meet
face to face and talk amongst themselves
and
say," well what's this provision of
Article four mean and what
do you mean citizen, and why isn't there a
bill of rights?"
You couldn't have easily done that,
actually, in Virginia,
town by town because it doesn't have a
township structure.
So, you had special ratifying conventions
were as
democratic as, you were going to get in
1787.
As democratic as was reasonably possible.
It does mean that there was some
malapportionment in, in some
of the, the states.
The Federalists didn't always benefit from
the malapportionment.
I think it may have helped them in
South Carolina, might have hurt them in
Massachusetts, but
in any event, they didn't basically make
all the,
the ,uh, the ground rules that, that
preexisted them.
They have to kind of work with, with the
legal structures that they inherited.
And the legal structures they inherited
basically they
tried to tweak by saying, let's have
special
conventions elected in the most democratic
way
imaginable given the rules of our society.
And I think, the, the ratification really
did cash out that, idea of the people.
So the phrase, the people, in the preamble
is echoed in Article seven by the phrase
conventions.
These special bodies, specially selected.
so, not just the ordinary lawmakers.
This,
but people with a special mandate, you
know?
You vote for a legislature, and you think
they're going to, it's going to
be about how to, how to, put the surplus
in a lock box.
And it turns out that the issues that
really confront
that Congress are going to be how to deal
with nine -11.
So when legislature, you vote for them
for, two years.
And they're going to just decide also to
stuff that may come up.
These conventions.
A Special election on one issue that you
know about.
You've been given the constitution as a
voter.
You can,you can read it and then vote for
people who promise they're
going to be basically supportive in
this convention, or they're going to be
skeptical.
But you're going to want them to go and
talk and listen and and then vote only
after they've heard all the arguments all
the
way around, because you can't do that
yourself.
So you vote for people that you think are
going to sort of
represent your instincts on this proposal
that you have in front of you
before you vote for them.
So that's the idea of conventions of the
people at the founding.
But Article seven does one other really
interesting thing.
It says the Constitution will go into
effect among whatever nine states say yes.
13 don't have to say yes.
What do you mean?
We talked about what do you mean by the
people.
Now what do you mean by the United States?
And, and Article seven says the United
States basically means any nine.
Nine is required.
If less than nine say yes, we're stuck
with the Articles of Confederation.
But if nine say yes, the Constitution will
go into effect among the states so
ratifying, okay?
So why that rule?
because the states are sovereign.
because if Rhode Island says no, it
doesn't
matter if the other 12 states have said
yes.
Rhode Island gets to decide for itself.
It's sovereign under the Articles
of Confederation.
It's retained sovereignty.
So Rhode Island will only be in if she
says yes.
No state can bind any other.
But how is it that only nine are required?
The Articles of Confederation, professor,
said 13.
Yes it did.
But it also said everyone is going to
abide by the Articles
of Confederation, and the states aren't
abiding by the Articles of Confederation.
Rhode Island, for example, has promised to
pay into the federal coffers and do other
things, and it's not doing that.
All the states promised to basically
follow the articles and they're not.
And so, precisely because each state is
sovereign, if the
treaty, which is all the Articles of
Confederation really is,
isn't really being implemented properly,
the states can basically disregard
it and supercede it, under the last in
time rule.
They agree to this treaty but it's not
working and so they can,
chose a different system.
That's the legal argument for why they are
allowed to disregard the articles.
13 is unworkable.
Rhode Island is never going to say yes, so
either, we're going to
go down with this ship or, instead, we're
going to come up
with a plan, at least nine of us, if we
can
agree amongst ourselves, are going to
create a new, more perfect union.
And no ones bound absent their consent
but, once you're
in you're in and this new thing is not
going to be
a mere treaty, it's not going to be
Articles of Confederation; a League.
It's not going to be a thing with each
state is sovereign, we're
going to create a perfect union,
indivisible
on the model of Scotland and England.
Once you're in you're in.
You don't have to join, and that's what
this picture is all about.
George Washington is elected president and
only eleven states are in this new Union.
North Carolina hasn't said yes yet, Rhode
island hasn't said yes
yet, but eleven states have said yes, and
they are going to go
into this thing.
This new United States on their own, no
state is bound absent is consent.
But, once you're in, you're in.
And Article five is going to say, gee for
future amendments even if your state votes
against an amendment, if three quarters of
the
other states vote yes, you're bound by
that.
So, once you're in, you're in.
Article five is different than Article
seven.
The nine don't, the 11 don't bind the two
the nine wouldn't bind
the four if nine said yes and four said
no.
But Article five is going to say, once you
do vote for the Constitution you're bound
by it.
Now, Constitution, we've come to the end
of the original Constitution,
this rear portico of the original
document, sort of balancing the Preamble.
It was originally supposed to be the end
of the
document, it turns out it's not the end of
the document.
Because they've added a bunch of
amendments to the thing.
And that's what we're going to start
talking
about now, the amendments to the
constitution.
So the amendments get tucked on to the end
of the constitution.
So what began as this kind of rear porch
rear portico of
the original constitution has now become
kind of a passageway, to the amendments.
So that's what we're going to talk about
for
the the rest of this segment of the
course.
So stay tuned.
