Welcome back.
Let's take a look at this picture over
here, and think about our constitution.
There's nothing explicit in the written
constitution that specifies a right to
have a pet dog, or to relax on one's
porch.
To raise one's children.
To, play the fiddle.
To, wear a hat.
To, enjoy family life.
And the privacy of, of one's home.
The, the written Constitution does not
specify
any of these rights with great
particularity.
And yet these rights are, rank among the
basic rights of Americans.
They are protected by courts.
These unlisted, unenumerated, unwritten
rights
are protected by courts.
And are rarely
interfered with, messed with, by ordinary
governments except in
unusual situations involving some
extraordinary or compelling
government interest justifying the
intrusion.
So, what's up with that?
How is it that
we have all these unwritten rights?
That's what, the question I'd like to
explore
with you in this lecture and the next one.
There are constitutional texts that signal
the written constitution signals that
when it comes to rights, the listing, the
enumeration, the writing is incomplete.
Let me read to you from the Ninth
Amendment.
The enumeration in the constitution of
certain rights, that is the textual
listing.
That's what an enumeration is, a listing.
The enumeration in the constitution of
certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others
retained by the people.
So apparently these, these other rights
that
are retained by the people that aren't
necessarily
enumerated, written, specified, textual.
So that's great, the Ninth Amendment
suggests
that there are these other rights,
unfortunately
it doesn't give us a lot of explicit
guidance about how to find them.
But it suggests that they, that they're
out there,
and that they shouldn't be denied or
disparaged and disregarded.
Given insufficient weight.
Now, here's a, a key sentence from the
14th Amendment.
No state shall make or enforce any law
which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States.
So, again there's this seemingly sweeping,
textual
suggestion that there are privileges and
immunities
of citizens of the United States that,
that are not supposed to be abridged.
But not a lot of specific textual guidance
about what those privileges and
immunities are, or how to find them.
And here's one
suggestion, that in trying to figure out
what the rights
of the people are, we, in some way, need
to look to the people.
And to try to figure out what the, the
rights of citi,
the privileges and the news or citizens
are, we need to pay attention
to the citizenry.
We've already developed a couple of
techniques that helped us draw meaning
from what the people have said, and, and
done.
And I'm going to introduce you to yet
another technique in this chapter.
But remember, we've already talked about
the technique
of reading the Constitution as a whole and
finding
implicit principles.
And we've already talked abut the
technique of
paying attention to how Americans actually
did ordain
and establish and later amend their
Constitution, and
try to deduce principles from, from their
very actions.
So.
For example, if a right is textually in
the constitution, well it's
got a connection to the people, because
the people put it in there.
We, the people, authorized the
constitution and
its amendments.
And if in the process of adopting a
certain constitutional text, we
embodied certain ideas, like robust free
speech, as we in fact did.
We, the people, when we adopt the
constitution,
I would say that, that has an obvious
connection to the people because the
people, action,
the process of adopting the constitution
embodied free speech.
So, so, that technique obviously is one
way of flushing out this idea.
Finding rights of the people.
If the text doesn't explicitly, in the
Constitution, affirm
a right, but implicitly does so, well,
since that text
was authorized by the people, I think that
people
authorized the, not just the explicit
right, but its implications.
So, for example.
Way back when we were talking about
reading
the Constitution as a whole, we used some
structural
examples about how the government is
organized that may
be pretty far from the question of
individual rights.
Question like whether the vice president
could preside at his own impeachment
trial.
Or, whether a president was immune
from a sitting president, from criminal
prosecution.
But those techniques that we
developed can also be used to think about
individual rights.
Unenumerated rights.
So remember, for example, we said, well
surely if the vice president
can't preside over the president's
impeachment trial, because he
would stand to gain in office, improperly,
he shouldn't be
able to preside over his own trial, where
he stands to lose an office
It follows a fortiori, we discussed.
Even more strongly, if you can't preside
over the president's
impeachment trial you can't preside over
your own impeachment trial.
Now that wasn't a rights issue, that was a
structure issue.
But the same implicit principle applies.
Let's take for
example the 6th Amendment.
It says that you have the right to compel
the production of witnesses in your favor.
Well surely, you could say, well since I
have a right to compel a
wit, a witness, I also have a right to put
a witness on the stand who will support
my, my case, even if the person testifies
voluntarily.
Or, let's take double jeopardy.
You know, the Fifth Amendment says you
can't be put twice in jeopardy.
Well, surely, it follows
for sure you can't be put three times in
jeopardy, or four times in jeopardy.
Let’s take we’ll, let’s go back to free
speech and develop an implicit argument
for free speech.
I already told you about how free speech
was part of
the process by which the Constitution was
adopted, an enactment argument.
But, but the First Amendment says that
even if Congress has passed a law
authorizing
the president to censor speech.
Free speech prevails, because Congress
shall
make no law abridging freedom of speech.
So if a president, even with a
Congressional law,
can't censor speech, it follows a
fortiori, the argument might
go and, I think does go, that the
president on
his own, without a congressional law,
can't censor free speech.
So certain rights, as I said, are kind
of implicit in the textual enumeration and
in that have a,
a connection to the people, because the
people authorized those textual rights.
But now here's a totally different way of
thinking about unenumerated rights.
Also connecting them to the people, but in
a different way.
Not in the way of close reading, finding
implicit rights.
And not simply in the way
of paying attention to history, how did
the people adopt the Constitution.
So, so we're going back to school
together, you and I.
And so we've done reading and we've done
history, now let's do arithmetic.
Let's count.
Lets take account of and take a count of
how ordinary people in their day to day
lives actually,
live them out, and in the process, embody
rights that become basic
American rights as a matter of custom and
practice and, and consensus.
Looking at what we do.
Not we the people on the grand stage
adopting or amending the Constitution.
But, and we the people ordaining something
in some momentous event, but,
but we the people in ordinary moments.
Not in ordainment,
momentous actions but in ordinary moments,
how we the people just kind of live out
our lives in, in in daily ways.
And we're going to come back to that.
You know we, we play the fiddle, and we
raise our
children, and we have pets, and we relax
on our porch.
let's, let me begin actually by, by
picking something from the criminal, some
examples
from the criminal justice system.
And then I'll work my way forward and, and
start talking about privacy rights in the
home, and,
and and at the, and then I'll come back
maybe to, to some other, examples from the
criminal.
Suppose, here's a question.
Where do you get the right to testify
in, to take the stand in your own criminal
case if
you are a criminal defendant?
Here's something that might startle you.
But the constitution, the written
constitution,
doesn't guarantee you a right, doesn't
explicitly
say that you have a right to take the
stand and defend yourself.
And here's something even more dramatic or
shocking, maybe, to some of you.
At the time of the founding, no one in
America had
such a right.
No federal criminal courtroom allowed
defendants to testify, no state criminal
courtroom at the time of the founding
allowed criminal defendants to testify.
The text says that you can't be compelled
to testify in a case, but it doesn't
talk about whether you have to be allowed
to, and at the founding you weren't.
And here was one of the reasons at the
founding you weren't.
Well, let me, before I tell you that.
So, the founding, the text doesn't say so
and no
court lets you, and today that's a basic
American right.
Everyone in America has that.
The Supreme Court unanimously believes
that, left, right and center.
Justice Alito's maiden, he's kind of on
the right of the court, and
his maiden opinion as a Supreme Court
justice, he, he writes for the
court an opinion that presupposes the
basic right
of Americans to testify in their own
behalf.
So what's up with that?
How did we get that right?
And that right is not controversial.
You don't hear politicians railing against
activist judges.
You don't see any faction on the court
saying well, this one, this one's made up.
So how did we get that?
And here's how.
At the founding, actually, the prohibition
on criminal defendants taking the stand
was, was
actually seen as a favor to the defendant.
The idea was that if you were allowed to
testify, you might feel pressured
to testify, because if you didn't, maybe
the jury would hold it against you.
Well, if he's innocent, why isn't he
taking the stand to say so?
And so you'd feel kind of pressured to
take the stand, in tension with this right
not to be compelled to take the stand.
And in addition, you might be tempted
actually if you were guilty, to commit
perjury.
To lie about it.
And if you did, well maybe you'd actually,
you know, even if you saved your skin,
you'd lose your soul, because you would
have
committed premeditated perjury and, and
risked a punishment
in the afterlife.
And that that was actually maybe
punishment for premeditated perjury might
be sort
of way worse than for the petty crime that
you may have, have committed.
Some sort of, unpremeditated assault or
something.
But now, because you have a natural
instinct of self preservation in the
courtroom, you actually told a lie, a
premeditated lie, which is much worse.
So the law itself would have led men into
temptation.
So as a favor to you, we're not going to
let you testify.
And, but, oh, by the way, this doesn't
seem so weird at
the founding, because no civil defendant
can testift, no civil plaintiff can
testify.
No one who was interested, who had a stake
in the case was allowed to testify.
It was kind of like the rule that no one
should be a judge in his own case.
The thought was, just as no one should be
a judge
in his own case, no one should really be a
a
witness in his own case.
If you have a stake, a dog in the fight,
so to speak, you shouldn't be testifying.
Well, as time passed, that understanding
kind of began to change in the states.
And by
the time of the Civil War and shortly
thereafter, in civil cases,
civil defendants were allowed to testify,
and civil plaintiffs were allowed
to testify and now it starts to seem
really weird.
Well, gee, why shouldn't criminal
defendants
have the same rights as civil defendants.
If juries can be trusted to sort out the,
the conflicting stories, let everyone talk
even if they're interested,
and the jury can sort it out, if they can
do that in civil cases, why not in
criminal cases.
If criminal defendants are supposed to
have more rights than civil
defendants, because their lives and limbs
are on the line there, their reputations
and, and honor if they are supposed to
have more rights, than civil defendants.
And when you read the constitution as a
whole, it
really does seem that they're supposed to
have more rights.
Gee, how can we let civil defendants
testify and not criminal defendants.
And so state after state begins to
recognize a right
of criminal defendants to testify as a
matter of state practice,
state statute state common law, state
constitutional provisions.
And then when enough states kind of joined
that bandwagon, the
US Supreme Court says, now, everyone has
to do with it.
That is an unenumerated right.
So that's a kind of a counting story.
As social practices changed, new rights
were recognized, and the
Supreme Court gave its blessing to these
new unenumerated rights.
Take proof beyond
reasonable doubt.
Proof beyond responsible doubt is not a
phrase that you see in the original
constitution.
Its doesn't say so in so many words.
It actually is a phrase that postdates the
Bill of Rights and the 19th Amendment,
that, it
kind of emerges as a phrase on the
scene, shortly after the Bill of Rights is
adopted.
But state after state after state
recognizes
this idea of proof beyond reasonable doubt
that, that unless there's very strong
evidence that someone has actually
committed a crime, he shouldn't be
convicted, and after states
do this, the Supreme Court eventually says
this, too, is an unenumerated
right.
So let's take rights,
the right to produce reliable physical
evidence of your innocence.
The constitution doesn't quite say that
you
have a right, for example, to introduce
DNA
evidence, physical evidence, someone else
Did it,
but of course you have such a right.
The, the whole purpose of a trial is to
sort out the innocent from the guilty.
That's the kind of argument about the
implicit Constitution.
The whole purpose of these criminal
procedure provisions
is to sort out the innocent from the
guilty.
And court after court you know in,
in America daily, lets defendants show,
introduce physical evidence of their
innocence.
It's part of the lived experience of
America, even if it's not explicit.
So, the text says only that you can't be
compelled to testify against yourself.
But you have all these unenumerated rights
in the criminal justice system.
To testify on your own behalf, even though
the text
doesn't say so and founding practice was
to the contrary.
To not be convicted unless there's proof
beyond reasonable
doubt, a phrase that postdates the Bill of
Rights.
To introduce reliable physical evidence of
your, your innocence,
even though the text doesn't say anything
of the sort.
So there are a whole bunch of criminal
procedure provisions,
and we don't read them narrowly and
literalistically and say, that's it.
We actually, in practice do justice to
the idea that there are unenumerated,
unwritten rights.
And note one key thing, more rights are
okay.
Nevertheless, if the text says you have a
certain right, then you have
that right, and that can't be taken away
merely because practices start to change.
So, there's a, a ratchet here.
Unenumerated rights,
yes, unenumerated restrictions, on, on
ancient liberties, not so fast.
We put them in the text, then unless we
amend them away, they're yours to stay.
You know so it's, it's actually a good
deal for the, the citizens, sort of.
What's mine is mine, and what's yours is
negotiable.
These textual rights are here to stay, but
there are additional unenumerated rights.
So those are a few examples from the
criminal
justice system.
Now let me take
a, a phrase that some of you may have
heard.
It's a very weird phrase.
It's a phrase that lawyers use a lot.
And it confuses laypeople, and for a good
reason.
Because it's confusing.
The phrase is, substantive due process.
And that's a phrase you won't see in the
written constitution.
And for an obvious reason, that process is
usually
defined in contradistinction to, in to
opposition to substance.
So process or procedural rules like, do
you have a jury trial, is there proof
beyond reasonable doubt, what kind of
evidence rules
apply, and procedural rules apply in this
trial.
But substantive due process has been a
phrase that judges have used to recognize
rights that, that go beyond courtroom
procedure.
Probably the most famous substantive, or
one of the most famous, substantive due
process rights of
the mid-twentieth century was a case
called Griswold v Connecticut.
And in that case, the Supreme Court
invalidated a
Connecticut law that made it a crime for
even
a married couple to use contraception in
the privacy of their bedroom.
And one of the best arguments for the
correctness of that result came
from a concurring opinion by a man named
Justice Harlan, John Marshall Harlan II.
His grandfather, John Marshall Harlan the
elder, was also on the Supreme Court.
The elder Justice Harlan was the great
dissenter in Plessy v Ferguson, and wrote
powerful opinions in many other cases.
And what a name, John Marshall Harlan.
Named after John Marshall, and then the
first John
Marshall Harlan was on the Court, and his
grandson,
John Marshall Harlan II was on the court
in
the middle of the 20th century, an
Eisenhower appointee.
And here's what John Marshall Harlan said.
He was a kind of a conservative but he
joined the liberal justices in, in the
Warren Court,
in Griswold vs Connecticut to invalidate
this Connecticut
law, and he basically said, this law is
un-American.
No other state other than Connecticut has
interfered
with the ability of a married couple to
have conjugal relations in the privacy of
their
bedroom, it was a kind of counting thing.
Look at the fifty states, no one else is
doing it, Connecticut, you've got to get
on board.
And although he talked about the use, the
phrase substantive due
process, because earlier cases had used
that phrase, I think it would
have been better off if he had simply
said, this is one
of the privileges and immunities of
citizenship that no state shall abridge.
Even the word privilege is kind of
connected to the
idea of, of, of privacy in an interesting
way.
And privilege isn't narrowly about process
rules, it can be substantive as well.
That was in the mid-60s.
In the early 70s, a case called Eisenstadt
versus Baird broadened the principle.
And in the middle of the sexual revolution
when contraception had become very
widely available, and ordinary, law
abiding
people are using contraception, even in
the
teeth of some laws that prohibit it, the
court struck down those laws, saying, laws
that make it a crime for even unmarried
couples to buy contraceptives,
not just to use them, but to buy them
those laws are unconstitutional,
because they're kind of inconsistent with
the emerging social practices on the
ground.
We don't just read the framers' enumerated
list of rights.
We looked at unenumerated rights that
ordinary people,
ordinary law-abiding people are living out
in their daily
lives and ordinary law abiding people are
using, married
people, as well as married people, are
buying contraception.
So that was another example.
More recently, the Supreme Court struck
down laws that prohibit
gays from and others from engaging in
certain sexual
behavior, anal sex, oral sex, in a case
called Lawrence vs Texas.
And the justices said, in this opinion
Justice Kennedy
writing for the court, among other things,
he, he counted,
he said, only 13 states have laws on the
books that prohibit this kind of intimate
consensual conduct in private, of those,
only four target
same sex conduct for special prohibition.
And so only 13 are doing this now,
and only four are targeting gays for
disadvantageous treatment.
Oh, and by the way, the laws
on the books in these places are
rarely enforced against consensual couples
in private.
And he explained why the laws, in fact,
there were reasons why, even
in the places where it was on, where this
laws were on the books
there were reasons why they were
almost never enforced against private
consensual conduct,
but only in cases of, of forcible
sexual activity, where, really, there,
there wasn't
consent, in private or where something
happened in public and you where offending
onlookers who, who, you know, who were
intruded upon
unreasonably because you took it out in
public rather than kept it in private.
So, in Lawrence v Texas, Justice Kennedy
plays a counting game and
says, these laws are basically becoming
un-American, and we hold them
unconstitutional
because they're inconsistent with the
lived experience of, of law-abiding
citizens.
I, I'm, I would predict that the court
will eventually come to say something
similar about gay marriage.
Where, when gay marriage becomes prominent
enough in
enough states, a court will basically say
it's
now become part of the lived fabric of
American life,
and the few outlier states have to get on
board.
Here's what the court has not said.
It hasn't said there's a right to medical
marijuana, because the lived practice
isn't there yet.
Very few states have recognized such a
right.
Even though maybe it's a morally
attractive right, the
court isn't just doing a philosophy game,
it's actually counting.
There are some people that believe that
you have a right to take, to end your own
life if, if you if you are competent, and
to enlist medical support for that.
They make philosophical arguments that
nothing could be more personal, none
of the government's business, than when
you choose to leave this world.
But the Supreme Court hasn't endorsed
that, and it hasn't, because
it says, we looked at all the states,
almost no state recognizes
this right.
This right is not part of the lived
experience, the lived fabric of America.
So, in a bunch of these substantive due
process unenumerated rights cases, the
court is actually counting.
If it's in the text, it's protected.
But if it's not in the text, the
court basically looks to actual practices
and counts.
Now, there's one case where they didn't
quite do that.
And you might have heard the case.
The obscure case of Roe versus Wade.
And, in that case the court announced an
abortion right in a very sweeping fashion.
A right that, as the court announced it,
actually
was way out ahead of actual practice of
the states.
When Rowe came down, 49 of the 50 states
actually, basically,
were out of sync with the rules that Roe
laid down.
And Roe, perhaps for that
very reason, has been extremely
controversial, because it didn't merely
track the lived experience of ordinary
Americans state by state.
Now, we're going to come back to
Roe in later lectures, there's another
argument in
Roe other than substantive due process
that might
help us think about the, the abortion
issue.
It involves women's rights and women's
equality.
In fact there's going to be a whole
chapter
on women's rights a little bit down the
line.
So so we're not done with Roe v Wade.
And nor are we done with our discussion
of of unenumerated rights based on custom
and practice.
So in the next lecture, I'm going to come
back to this picture,
tell you a little bit more about privacy
rights, rights in the home.
And we'll also talk about cruel and
unusual punishment, which involves courts
doing the same kind of counting
game that we've been talking about thus
far, so stay tuned.
