Hi everybody, welcome to the week eight
bonus
materials for Professor Akhil Amar's
Constituinal Law Coursera Class.
I'm Daniel one of your TF's and I'm going
to pick up
where we left off last week with the
online q and a session.
By answering some of the questions that we
didn't
have the chance to address in the online
forum.
So I wanted to start off with a question
that James Rasts asked.
And that was about tears of scrutiny, and
he said, you know I've heard that
the Supreme court often will use different
tears of scrutiny for different types of
cases.
What's that about?
Could you explain that?
so, first I have to give a little hat
tip to Alec, who originally responded to
this question.
because he gave a very good answer that
actually
pretty thoroughly laid out what this
scrutiny language means.
But, I just wanted to talk a little about
it and to help clarify things further.
So, as Alec suggested, the tiers of
scrutiny are generally involved in equal
protection cases.
So, cases arising under the Fourteenth
Amendment.
So if we remember from some of our earlier
lectures,
the 14th Amendment or Section One of the
14th Amendment says
among other things, that no state shall
de-, shall deny to
any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws.
So That's pretty vague language.
Question what does it really mean?
An obvious answer would be something like
well everybody has to be treated equally.
We can't have laws that discriminate
right?
But obviously that's not quite
satisfactory because every law
discriminates or at least most do in way
or another.
If I pass a law that says cocaine is
illegal.
Which indeed is a law that we've passed.
That makes it discrimination between
people who use
cocaine and people who don't use cocaine,
right.
People who want to use cocaine are
adversely
affected by this law, in some cases very
significantly.
They might face long prison terms.
And people who don't want to use cocaine
are fine.
Alright, so really we, what we say when we
say no states can deprive equal
protection of the laws, we mean certain
types
of discrimination, certain types of
classifications aren't alright.
And the Supreme Court has spent a lot of
time trying to figure
out, trying to explain what types of
classifications are alright and what types
aren't.
And so the basic framework they've come up
with is a three tiered system of scrutiny.
And so the lowest level is what's called
the, the rational base of scrutiny.
And that's, the, amount of scrutiny that's
applied to kind of most every day
legislation.
For example, you know economic regulation
that said you
need to be, this is actually a thing in
this
case, you need to be a particular type of
license
optician in order to sell particular types
of eyeglasses, right.
That a law like that would.
Be subject to rational basis scrutiny,
which
means in order to survive a challenge, it,
the government only needs to show that
it's rationally related to some legitimate
government interest.
And the court has generally interpreted
that standard very loosely.
So as long as the government can come
forward and
say there was a reason, basically, that we
passed this law.
We weren't just completely making it up.
The law will be upheld.
Now, on the other end of the spectrum is
what's called strict scrutiny.
And the court tends to apply this when
laws
differentiate in ways that, that are
called suspect classifications.
And the most notable example of this is
race, classifications based on race.
But But other other categories have been
thrown in there too.
the, the, doctrine originally emerged from
a case called Korematsu v.
The United States, which is an infamous
moment in Supreme Court
history when the Supreme Court actually
said that Japanese internment were
constitutional.
But at least while they were doing that
they said that.
You know, a racial classification, like
say putting only Japanese people in
these prison camps, basically, needs to
be narrowly tailored to a compelling
interest.
So, as opposed to rational basis, where we
just said, just give us a
reason and we're good to go, here It can't
be any reason, it has
to be a compelling government interest,
and you can't just show that this law
forwards that interest, you have to show
that it's narrowly tailored to that
interest, right?
So, there couldn't have been less
restrictive means
that you could of used to forward the
interest.
And then in between strict scrutiny and
rational
basis there's something that the court has
called.
Intermediate scrutiny.
In which case something has to be
substantially related to a important
Government interest.
So, as you can see that language is
sort of, kind of, trying to chart a
middle course between rational basis on
the
one hand, strict scrutiny on the other.
But, notable instance where this has
been applied is some gender discrimination
cases.
But but this is a very complicated topic,
as my kind of high-level explanation
probably already suggests.
So, I encourage you to go read up on on
this.
There's tons of material out there in the
secondary
literature, but thanks, James, for
bringing the issue up.
So the next issue that I wanted to
talk about is related to rights in the
Constitution.
And this is a question that Rob and noone
will actually ask, which is, you hear
a lot of talk about the idea on the one
hand, that rights are sort of.
People have rights because they're people,
right?
They have human rights, natural rights.
And then the other, some people sort of
talk about rights
as if they were kind of conferred by a
government or positive rights.
You have these rights because we've chosen
to give them to you.
And you know, Rob was little critical of
the
idea of natural rights and he has, I mean.
Are, was the creation of the Bill of
Rights and the US Constitution
sort of responsible for leading to the way
that we think about rights today.
And I'd say yes and no.
I think it's important to consider the
extent to
which the constitution and the way it
talks about rights.
Actually it does or doesn't reflect.This
idea
that everyone just has rights because
they're people.
Because, you know they're human.
In particular, I'd like to use this chance
to bring
up the work of one of Professors Ahmad
colleagues actually.
Another famously constitutional law
scholar here
at Yale called Bruce Ackerman, and Bruce
Ackerman is written a famous series of
books actually called We the People.
And in the first of his books first volume
of the We The People series.
He talks a little about 3 different ways
that you
could think about your kind of rights visa
vi in government.
So on one hand you have democratic monism.
So that's sort of the weakest conception
of what rights are.
In a democratic monis vision of the world.
The popular majorities can basically do
what they want.
If we pass a law that gets 51% of the
vote.
That's the law and if you don't like it.
If it, you know, makes you do something
that you
think the Government shouldn't be able to
make you do.
Tough luck.
You know, bring it to the ballot box.
Try to win the next election.
And then the other side of the spectrum.
Might be a what he calls a rights
foundationalist approach.
And this is sort of a kind of natural
rights human rights [INAUDIBLE].
There are certain rights that are so
fundamental
that the government can never intrude on
them.
But the political community no matter how
many people that
we should do x if x intrudes on these
rights.
Doesn't matter.
Still can't do it.
And then he suggests a intermediate view,
called a dualist view.
Right.
Where maybe we take certain rights and we
think that they're important enough that
we want
to enshrine them and make them very, very
hard for the political community to
intrude on.
But maybe not impossible.
And so.
Bruce Ackerman says that you can look
around the world and you
can see different types of constitutional
systems that follow these different
models.
So if you want an example of democratic
monism, you'd
go to the United Kingdom, that in Britain
you actually.
You know?
The.
Britain.
Britain is famous for having a long
history of rights.
But those are really rights against the
King.
You don't actually have rights against
Parliament.
If Parliament, which is the embodiment of
The
people, their elected representatives
decides to pass a law.
And you think it intrudes on your rights.
You're out of luck.
There's no higher law against which
Parliament has helped.
On the flip side, if you want an example
of foundational rights constitution.
Bruce Ackerman say's the German
Constitution.
And the German Constitution actually says,
you
know there are certain Provisions, that
basic law.
Certain, certain rights that are so
fundamental that we
can never go back and re, take away those
rights.
Doesn't matter how many people agree, we
can't, you know, amend
our Constitution or do anything to change
these sort of fundamental precepts.
But then the American Constitution
according to Ackerman, and I
think this is a compelling view, Is a
democratic dualist constitution.
It's somewhere in between, right?
It lays out certain rights, certainly, in
the Bill of Rights.
But they're not exempt from amendment.
If we were to change our mind later, we
could change,
we could, we could repeal portions of the
Bill of Rights.
We could, we could debate what rights do
people really have and what rights they
don't.
But we can't just do it through normal
politics.
51% of the country can't Take away, you
know,
your fourth amendment rights against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
But, if we use the article 5 process, we
actually could.
So, I'd say that the United States
Constitution
is in fact a sort of dualist constitution.
It isn't necessarily espousing exactly the
kind of natural rights or
human rights that you, Rob, that you were
a little concerned about.
But it's interesting to think about.
The way that these different theories of
rights play
out in the American constitution and in
other constitutions.
So then I wanted to bring up another
question from Eduardo Felix de Crus,
That was a question about what's, what's
Professor Marrs reading of the ninth
amendment.
Remember the right, the ninth amendment
says, well
just because something isn't really
mentioned in the constitution,
that doesn't mean that that should be
construed
to deny the existence of any other rights
elsewhere.
And, what it rightly asks, so what's
Professor Marr's view of that.
And if there are other rights out there,
where do they come from?
How do we find them?
So I just wanted to read a little
passage that, from Professor Mars' book"
America's Unwritten Constitution".
This starts on page 102.
He says," Although the ninth amendment
offers little detailed guidance about how
to find un-enumerated rights, it does give
us one powerful textural clue..."
Proudly echoing the Preamble, the
Amendment
speaks of unenumerated rights of the
people.
Proper enumerated rights should be popular
rights.
Rights that the American people, and not
merely a few judges following their
own subjective sensibilities, have in some
way or another endorsed, embraced,
enacted, embodied.
So, that may not seem entirely concrete, I
mean he doesn't say so
it's A, B, C, and D, but he does kind of
give you a
sort of methodology for how to think about
whether a right is really a
right of the American people, whether we
have somehow embodied it in our culture.
And in fact, a lot of this book is
about different ways of finding What those
unenumerated rights are.
And a this relates actually a little to a
question a few other people asked on the
discussion forum.
Which is are there judicial opinion that
Professor Marr disagrees with.
Situations where the court has found
rights
that Professor Marr thinks you just can't
find.
And I think the answers yes and the
methodology's laying out there
sort of, sort of explains how you might
find one if those instances.
For example when the Court tried to, or
sorry, has put forth something called the
Exclusionary Rule.
That evidence that you find through an
unreasonable
search under the Fourth Amendment isn't
admissable in court.
Professor Maher thinks that actually, that
right can't be found.
Not just in the text but also in the
kind of, surrounding History ethos of the
American people.
So you know, you, you can, I think that he
discusses actually
in great length exactly what kind, what
kind of sources you can use.
What you can consult to really figure out
whether something makes the cut.
And then the final question that I wanted
to
bring up, and this actually comes from
James Rasts again.
So congratulations James, that you got two
in here.
and, and, I just want to bring it
up because I think it's, interesting,
little point.
And actually it is related to some
litigation going on right now.
What he said is, you know.
If corporations are people, why can't they
be drafted for the military?
I think this is an interesting question
because, you
now share this phrase tossed about all the
time.
Well corporations are people.
Mitt Romney famously said this when he was
campaigning for president.
A couple years back and you say,
corporations are people, my friend.
And and people often associate this with
the recent
Supreme Court opinion, Citizens United
versus Federal Elections Commission.
Which held that corporations had certain
free speech rights
that couldn't be impinged on under the
first amendment.
But I think it's important to clarify that
the court has never held as a broad
matter.
If corporations are people, in all
circumstances.
Clearly it's a bit of a contextual
inquiry.
And I think part of what reveals that, is
that there are these circumstances
in which it would feel like it is absurd
to talk about corporations as people.
For example, corporations can't vote.
Or corporations can't run for president.
Or, and this is the example James pointed
out, corporations can't be drafted.
I mean, it, it's unclear what that would
even really
mean to say, send a corporation to fight
in the war.
Like, Coca-Cola, can Coca-Cola go to
Afghanistan to, to fight?
so, so, it's clearly a contextual inquiry.
And as I said, these types of questions,
so what kind of circumstances are
corporations Like
people and what kind of circumstances are
they
not are actually very relevant for a
contemporary litigation.
There's a case you may have heard of, or
actually a couple of cases.
Ha, one, Hobby Lobby, and another
Constelga, which are related.
And this is about the,
mandate under the new health insurance law
that
employers, provide health insurance that
offers contraceptive coverage.
And certain employers have said, well, you
know, that violates our religious believes
because we, we, we think con,
contraception is immoral under our
religious tenets.
We don't want to provide our employees
with health insurance that covers that.
And the claim that they're asserting is
actually.
Not entirely under the Constitution, it's
under a, a statute called the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, the RFRA, but we
don't have to get into the details.
The reason I bring this up is because an
interesting question
in this case is can a corporation have a
religion, because these
are not individuals who say I can't
provide health insurance for
someone, they're corporations that say we
can't provide health insurance for
someone.
And it seems a little funny to say, well,
the corporations religious free exercise,
the corporations religious beliefs
are somehow being infringed upon forcing
it to provide
contraception coverage in its health
insurance to its employees.
But we're going to have to see how the
court ultimately rules about this.
But if there, whether a corporation can
have a religion under what kind of
circumstances.
If this is a circumstance like a
corporation being drafted where it just
doesn't
make sense to think of it the way that we
think of a natural person.
So thanks a lot for all your great
questions.
Of course I didn't even come close to
addressing all of the good ones that
got put up there, but I look forward to
hearing more from you in the future.
Thanks a lot.
