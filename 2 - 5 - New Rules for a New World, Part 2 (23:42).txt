Welcome back, we're talking about Article
1 of
the United States Constitution which
focuses on the
Congress of the United States, and we are
focusing particular attention on the
structure of that Congress.
The House of Representatives, elected by
the
people and we've been talking about
whether
it's really genuinely living up to the
promise that will be representative of the
people.
The anti-federalists in the 1780's were
worried that it
really wouldn't be that it would be too
small
to be genuinely representative, and the
Federalist countered well,
you don't want it to be too big either,
okay.
Five people is probably too small, 50 is
better we concede.
Is 500 unambiguously better than, than 50.
Okay,
maybe even if that were so, although
almost no state legislature has 500.
Would 5000 be better than 500, would
50,000 be better than 5,000?
At a certain point, said the Federalists.
Though, if the legislature is too big,
you can't really have a conversation among
individuals.
It will, it will actually not be able to
get any, any work done.
It will just sort of degenerate into
cacophony.
So, there has to be a balance said the
Federalists.
The anti-fed, and here's
another reason that there needs to be a
balance.
You want your national laws to be filtered
through a body of,
of distinguished statesmen, of people who
might know more than the average voter.
The average voter should pick someone who
is going
to be expert at the art of, of
legislation.
Who might know a little bit more about the
rest of America, about the rest
of the world, because Congress will be
legislating in regards not just to
individual neighborhoods,
you know which pothole needs to be fixed
where, but great continental and, and
global affairs.
So, not that many people say the
Federalists
are going to be able to understand all of
that.
So you want a select body of
representatives who are going to
be able to have the confidence of the
voters, but also the expertise
necessary to provide for good governments,
and be able
to monitor the executive branch, and the
judicial branch.
So the Federalist say there needs to be a
balance.
And the Anti Federalists said, yes, but
you got the balance wrong, it's too small.
the, the, the constitution says that you
only have to have a minimum of 13.
One per state in the House of
Representatives, that's
not enough, and you provide for some
maximums and
you've initially said 91 total 26 in the
senate, 65 in the House, that's too small.
And the Federalists say, okay, maybe we
miscalculated.
We promise that soon, the Congress will
grow.
We'll have a bigger House of
Representatives as soon as
we get a first census, and indeed, they
did that.
The Federalists make another argument,
that because of geography and travel,
there, there may be some, it's going to be
more expensive to have a big House of
Representatives, cause people are going to
have to travel greater distances and tax
payers are going to have to pay for all of
that, this was a special
concern, at the Philadelphia convention,
for the
states that were far from the center.
Because in the Articles of Confederation,
you only need to
send two people, and you get your vote in
Congress
whether you send two delegates or seven.
You need to send your delegation, but, but
you don't
need to send more people in order to cast
your vote.
Under this new constitution, the voting in
both the
House and the Senate is per capita, by
individual rather
than by state so, so a state is going to
want all its representatives, all it's
senators to show up.
That's going to be an additional expense
especially if
the state is far from center to pay for
that travel.
Here's one thing that Federal said, the
national government should pay for these
representatives
and these senators, they shouldn't have to
be paid for by the state governments.
That should be a national obligation.
And, by the way, we are going to pay these
folks.
And that's a democratic idea, because if
we don't pay them, then only great men
of immense wealth as a practical matter,
are going to
be able to serve, so, here's a democratic
reform.
We will provide for payment of our
lawmakers, and today you might begrudge
the legislature.
You might say, well they don't do
very much, are they really earning their
salary?
But just think about it for a minute, if
we
didn't pay them, only the wealthy would be
able to serve.
In England, they don't start paying
members of
the house of commons until 1911, but
America's
constitution is way ahead of its time.
In the states, only Pennsylvania had
provided in
its constitution for payment for its
lawmakers and
that was understood as a great democratic
reform,
and the federal constitution Article I
copied that.
In effect, a lot of the
federal constitution copies the best state
practices.
So, Massachusetts and New hampshire had
ordained their constitutions
by a kind of special popular participatory
event.
And the preamble said, we're going to do
the same.
Pennsylvania pays for its lawmakers.
We're going to do the same for that.
Pennsylvania has no property
qualifications for its lawmakers.
Anyone can serve.
We're going to follow that model.
So Article 1 provides for no property
qualifications to be in the House of
Representatives.
No property
qualifications to be in the Senate.
Every state had property qualifications
for members of the upper
house, but for constitution to now a
couple of states didn't
have upper houses, but the 11 states that
did had
special property qualifications but not
the senate of the United States.
You could be a senator even if you didn't
have enough property to vote for your
state laws legislature.
We the feds will, say want to open this
system up to people of talent.
In the House of Commons, it calls itself
English
House of Commons, but actually you need it
to
own a considerable amount of property to
be a
member of the House of Commons, no
property qualifications whatsoever.
So it's Federalists say, we're make, we're
opening
it up to people of merit of all sorts.
And the anti-Federalist say, yeah but
you've made it so small,
the House of Representatives, that as a
practical matter, only people with fame
and reputations over pretty broad
geographic areas
are going to be able to win.
Formally open the game up to everyone, but
they said you kind of
rigged it in favor of, of, of, the, the,
the, famous and the powerful.
So that's the conversation.
The Federalist not only have no property
qualifications
in the constitution and Article 1 for the
legislature, no religious qualifications
either; that's pretty striking.
And who gets to vote?
There's no federal definition of a right
to
vote, no federal property qualifications
for the house.
The Constitution simply says, if you're
eligible to vote for the lower house
of your state legislature, you're eligible
to vote for the House of Representatives.
That's the broadest franchise imaginable
at the time in America.
In many states there were stricter
property qualifications for voting for the
Senate, stricter property qualifications
for, for
the state Senate, the state upper house.
Stricter property qualifications for
voting for the
state governor and so that the most
expansive
franchise in most of the states was for
the lower house of the state legislature.
And that's the electorate that will get to
pick U.S. House
of Representative's members.
And remember in the Articles
Confederation, you didn't
get to vote directly for your congress
persons.
And the Articles Confederation are picked
by the state legislature.
But in this new government, they're
going to be picked by the people.
Why?
Because in the Articles of Confederation,
the states are basically taxed.
They're requisitioned.
They're told to pay up certain money to
the, into federal coffers.
They often don't do it but, but they're
taxed and they're represented.
State governments as such.
In this new constitution, since the new
federal government, the new congress will
be
able to impose taxes on individuals,
individuals
should be represented in that new
government.
Remember what the American Revolution was
all about.
No taxation, without representation.
Parliament didn't represent us, so it
shouldn't be able to tax us.
One of the articles of confederation, the
states
were represented so only they can be
taxed.
But in this new entity because
individuals are going to be taxed, they're
going to have to be
represented, this House of Representatives
is
really supposed to derive from the people.
Here's another number from the
constitution.
Age qualifications.
Now you might think that's undemocratic.
You need to be 25 years old to be a
member of the House of Representatives, 30
to be a Senator.
You might think, well that's limiting the
people's choices.
The Federalists said, au contraire!
These age rules are actually deeply
egalitarian in their structure.
Why?
Because who is going to have the name
recognition to get elected to congress
at the age of 24, 23 or 22 or 21 or 18 or
16 for that one.
The only people that can get elected at
that young an age would actually be famous
people.
Famous sons of famous fathers sharing
the same first and last names.
We're going to, by having minimum age
qualifications
open our system up to talent of all sorts.
So that as a practical matter if you're,
if you're
famous maybe and your father is some
famous politician, go
into your state Legislature first, and,
and, and prove your
track record, and then, only after you're
25 years old,
and you have some record of your own, will
you be eligible for the
House of Representatives, and only after
you're
30, will you be eligible for the Senate.
And if we don't have that, here's what
will happen.
States will start sending their most
famous people to, to the national capitol
at a very young age, hoping that they'll
generate sen, get seniority and, and
and become famous in, in the, in the, in
the continental
politics at an early age, and that will
eventually benefit the state.
And so states are going to have incentives
to send people younger and younger and,
so that, so that their most distinguished
citizens get more clout in federal
politics.
And if one state does it, another state
will do it.
And that will create a race to the bottom
with states having a temptation
to send younger and younger folks, and
that will lead to a kind of aristocracy.
because the younger folks,
they're going to keep getting picked, if,
if that were the
world, it would be well born people,
people with famous names.
So, although it might seem to be a
restriction on the voters to say you can't
vote
for someone 24, 23, or 22, we're doing
it for egalitarian reasons, to open the
thing up.
So, if you are 30 years old and you don't
have a
lot of property you are eligible to be in
the Senate and, and
you will, as long as your fellow citizens
hold you in high regard, you are
a school teacher, you are a war hero, it's
not about whether you have property or
not, it's about whether you have virtue
and we are going to trust ordinary voters
to
pick the people that they think are best,
and we are going to pay those people.
Even if they don't have independent
wealth, in order to do the public's
business in Washington, in the national
capitol, which will soon become Washington
D.C
of course.
Now here is another number in Article One.
Two.
The members of the House of
Representatives are elected every two
years.
And the Federalists will say, look this is
pretty good.
In Parliament they are elected, they are
supposed to be elected,
you know, every, every seven years, but,
they're often not elected every.
Parliament is allowed to change the rules
in the middle
of the game.
So, they say seven years, but here, for
the House of Commons, here, our,
our House of Commons, our House of
Representatives is going to be elected
every two years.
And it will be fixed.
It can't be, manipulated by the incumbent
legislatures the way it can in Parliament.
Parliament has the flexibility to, to move
elections up or to
move them back but it's going to be every
two years fixed,
come Hell or high water.
And that's a deep democratic idea.
Say, of course, the constitution.
And even the Senate is every six years.
So, even our upper house is going to be
more
accountable than the lower house of the
English parliament.
And the anti-Feds will say not so fast.
You know, we shouldn't just be comparing
the
new congress to England compared to the
States.
In the States, basically, we have annual
election for members of the lower house.
And here you're doing it every two years
rather than every year.
And the Federalists response say, yeah,
but remember geography.
For state legislators, states are more
compact.
You can move more quickly from your
state house of representatives back to
your home.
But here you're going to have to go maybe
from the extremes of the continent from,
from New Hampshire or, or Massachusetts
from Georgia to some centrally located
capital.
It's going to take longer to travel.
And you're going to need to bone up
on continental issues, and, and foreign
affair stuff.
That's going to take some time.
There's going to be more of a learning
curve.
And, and so two years makes sense given
the unique geography
of a continental regime that we're trying
to, to create.
So that's why.
And by the way, more frequent elections,
say the Federalists, aren't always and
everywhere better.
If one year is so much better than two
having an election every one
year, well, would it be better still to
have an election every six months?
How about every three months?
How about every month?
So the Federalists say there's going to be
a
balance, and two years strikes a sensible
balance.
So those are some of the, the, the, the
main features of the
congress and the, the constitution.
Some remarkably democratic
features that ordinary people get to vote,
elections are every two years.
We're going to pay lawmakers, we're gon,
not
going to have any property qualifications
for federal
lawmakers, even in the upper House, and
we're not going to have any property
qualifications,
because we are trying to create a genuine
republic of the people.
Remember, the federalists have to persuade
ordinary people to vote for the
Constitution.
The Preamble, which says, we the people
that's only going to work if
the people do, we the people do ordain and
establish this Constitution.
Well of course they're going to have to
vote for it.
And will they vote for it if it has all
sorts of elitist
features in it, and so the Federalists
tried to persuade
their fellow citizens that it doesn't have
it's not filled with
elitist features but genuinely democratic
features, paying lawmakers, no property
qualification, no religious qualifications
by the way for law makers either.
The age limits, which might seem to limit
the the voters are in
fact in the, in the in the name of an, an
egalitarian Democratic spirit.
That's the Federalist argument.
Here's one other thing they say.
They they say oh, let me, before I, before
I, a final
point about the, what they say about the
apportionment of the house and senate.
Let me mention one other feature of, of
this building.
It needs to be large enough to accommodate
enough lawmakers from around the country,
but also
the viewing public, the galleries.
The constitution doesn't, in so many
words, guarantee a right for
the viewing public to show up, but the
federalists say listen,
our system is going to be open, and from
the beginning the
House of Representatives is open to public
view, to public galleries.
The Senate very soon follows suit.
So this is, this building is a big
building.
This, this house,
this Capital building, because it's the
people's house.
It's where you can go to watch the
people's business being conducted
publicly in the House of Representatives,
in the Senate with large galleries.
The White House is a different kind of
place, and
we'll talk about article two and the
presidency later on.
It's the private dwelling of one person
who does a lot of his work in secret.
It's not there for public inspection.
You don't want
that building to look like Buckingham
Palace, Versailles, some, some great
palatial estate,
because that's, that's one person, but the
legislature, Article I, that's the
people's branch.
Very distinctively, what you want a large
enough legislature, you want the
people to be there being able to observe,
you want a big building.
You want a big building for democratic
reasons.
So that's the Federalist
argument, one other important feature of
the structure of
congress, that we need to talk about, the
apportionment structure.
Larger states, more populous states are
going to
have more seats in the House of
Representatives.
In the Senate, it's going to follow the
model of the Articles Confederation.
Each state whether it's populous or not
will get an equal representation.
This, now in order to redeem the idea a
House of Representatives that really looks
like the people, you're going to need a
device
to keep that in sync with the people.
because the people are on the move, and
nowhere are they on the move more than
America.
You're going to have immigrants coming in,
you're going to have people being born.
Other people will be dying.
You're going to have people moving from
one state to another.
And the Constitution reflects all that
with this ingenous idea
of a census.
Every ten years we're going to count every
one up and
reallocate seats in the House of
Representatives based on that census.
That's a remarkably democratic idea
England hasn't had a census for
the entire 18th century and there have
been massive changes of
population with the ri, industrial
revolution, the rise of great cities
a, and there not many of the great
industrial cities in
England properly represented in the House
of Commons.
Which is massively malapportioned, filled
with what were called
rotten boroughs, so, places where almost
no one lives are
sending seats to Parliament, and places
where lots of
people live aren't sending seats, aren't
sending members to Parliament.
So that's a kind of, not a genuinely
representative system in the so-called
House of Commons.
Only a couple of states promise in their
state constitutions
to have reapportionment, to have a census.
Pennsylvania does, it's a democratic
state, very ahead of the game.
It hasn't done it yet, but it's promised
that.
So has New York.
And here too, the Constitution copies some
of the most democratic features, the best
features of, of the state constitutions.
They pick Pennsylvania as the model here.
Just as they picked Pennsylvania as the
model for low property
qualification no property qualifications
for payment of lawmakers.
Just as they picked Massachusetts as a
model for putting the constitution to a
vote.
So, on many of these issues, the Congress,
the
Constitution is, is copying best day
practices.
Now you might not like the Senate.
You might say the Senate is now
apportioned,
you know, big states and small states
count equally.
Even so, I'd want you to remember two or
three things about the Senate.
First, even if it's malapportioned, it's
no worst than the articles of
confederation which also had the one state
one vote idea so it's not any sort of
step back and second, there's not a
systematic
skew either at the founding or today a big
systematic skew in the senate you have.
Small States,
from the North, and small States from the
South.
You have small States in the East and the
West, it's, it's
it's not perfectly apportioned but it is,
there is not a systematic hew.
In England, the industrial centers were
systematically under represented.
In America the big states are kind of
North and South and East and West.
And so the small states and, maybe it
doesn't perfectly balance out but it's
not, it's not terrible.
It's no worse than the articles of
confedersation and it's not based on
property.
And many of, the states the upper house
was kind of connected to the property.
Folks.
In parliament, the upper house, the House
of Lords is about the rich people.
In the Senate, at least formally, it isn't
about that at all.
It's not trying to protect rich people as
such.
But there is one feature of Article 1,
that is about protecting, in effect,
property as such.
It's the most vicious feature of Article
1.
It will lead to, ultimately, a Civil War.
It's the representation of slavery in
the House of Representatives.
More populous state get more seats in the
House of Representative, but how do we
count population.
We have a census, but in that census,
slaves count.
Yes they count for a three fifths, so they
count for less than a free person.
But still, the more slaves the state has,
the more slaves
it steals from Africa.
Kidnaps of, of people born in freedom in
Africa and kidnaps
and, and brings over the Atlantic, the
more slaves that it breeds.
The more slaves it has, the more seats it
has in the House of Representatives.
That, and this is a one former property
that is given special protection in the
constitution,
cause you don't get extra votes because
you have more valuable
land or more valuable buildings or more
stocks and bonds, and other
kind of, of wealth, more cattle, in, in
your state, you
don't get any extra credit for any of
those forms of property.
But you do get extra credit in the House
Of Representatives, for extra slaves.
and, and that feature of the Constitution
is
the, the one that will over time create
a house divided, a house divided against
itself.
Because, that's a feature that's going to
recur every decade.
There's going to be a new census.
Then in that new census, they're going to
count the
slaves, and slaves are going to actually
increase in America.
And, that increase is going to be
reflected in extra seats for the slave
states in the House of Representatives.
And eventually, as I said that, that will
lead
to a crisis of the house, of a house
divided.
We'll talk a lot more about that in later
sessions.
So stay tuned.
