Welcome back.
We're in the middle of a guided tour, so
to
speak, of the written Constitution and
we're preceding In textual order.
We've already covered the Preamble, how we
the people
of the United States ordained and
established this the Constitution
in an epic act of continental democracy
and free speech,
the likes of which had never really before
been seen
in world history and, and, and in an, an
event that really Radically changed the
course of world history and that we
the people in United States did again
establish
that Constitution for reasons of, of
national
defense to secure the common defense and
thereby
preserve the secure the blessings of
liberty for
that generation of Americans and its Its
posterity.
So that was the preamble, and that was the
beginning, of, the, our, our guided tour.
Then we talked about Article One, the
Legislative Branch, this kind of, New
Congress.
Borrowing the name of the old Congress,
but,
but changing its powers and structure
quite considerably.
Legislative powers vested, in art, bah, in
Article One in a,um, in this, this
congress.
We talked about the executive power vested
in a president, a
newfangled president who'd be way more
than a governor state governor.
But, but much less dangerous than, than an
English monarch.
And that's Article Two of the
Constitution,
the executive power vested in a president.
And, and we talked about last and and I
think least among the branches of
the Federal Government.
We talked about the judiciary, the
judicial power
invested in judges, by Article 3 of the
Constitution.
Now at this point I, I hope, actually,
maybe you, you've
noticed two things, or two things that
come to your mind.
First, constitution's actually pretty
well-organized, sort of preamble,
how it's going to be ordained and
established, and legislature,
executive, judiciary, each in its own
separate article, kind of
separation of powers textually, article
one, article two, article three.
So I hope you notice that the Constitution
actually
has a rather ni- nice and tidy cohesive
organization.
An ordinary farmer 225 years ago could,
could understand the thing.
And it is designed to be understood.
The article's confederation, the pre,
the predecessor documents were much more
of
a jumble much less well organized I think.
And some of the state constituions were
realativy tidy, Massechusets constitution
comes to mind, others were a bit more of a
jamble.
So one thing you might have noticed is the
constitution is pretty well organized.
So I hope the lectures so far have been
fairly well organized too.
Cause we're just tracking that textual
flow.
Now it's complicated of course, because
you
can't really talk about one branch in
complete isolation to the other.
Let's take the veto power.
It's mentioned in Article One, because
it's part
of the process by which laws are made.
But of course, it's a power of the
president.
and, and he's front and center in Article
II.
Or, let's talk about presidential
impeachment.
Well, it's a limit on presidential power,
but the impeachment powers are vested
in the legislature and, the House of
Representatives which
gets to in effect indict a president,
charge him.
And the Senate which, which tries them and
so two, if a Judge is impeached
that is an Article 3 issue because it
involves limitation on the judicial power,
but it
is also an Article 1 issue, because the
house basically indicts the Senate, tries
a thing
in the Senate when it, when it tries an
impeachment it is sitting as a court
of sorts.
And so, that's a kind of judicial power,
if you will.
So, so I hope you've noticed it's pretty
well organized, but these things kind
of fit together and you can't fully
think about one branch of government
without thinking
about how it, it checks and balances, and
interacts with is blended with to some
extent, other branches of government even
though,
there's a basic presented separation of
powers in
Article One, Article Two, Article Three,
the three articles
all of which begin with a kind of vesting
clause.
Legislative power vested generally in the
Congress.
Executive power vested generally in a
President.
And, and judicial power vested in court.
So I hope that's one thing you noticed and
And maybe that, the
second thought that may have come into
your mind is like, well what's left?
I mean, we've done how the Constitution is
going to
be ordained and, and we've got three
branches of government
so, aren't we done?
Not quite.
Today we're going to end in, in this
lecture, and in its in
the next one we're going to talk about
Article 4 of the Constitution.
And, it focuses mainly on relations
between the states.
Think about, all kind of horizontal
federalism.
Federalism sometimes means the
relationship between the state
governments and the central government,
the federal government.
But sometimes, it can also refer to, and
the things are connected, more horiz-.
And that, and sometimes.
And that, that first thing is called
vertical federalism.
There's the central government kind of
above the states, to some extent.
Because when the federal government is
acting within its powers.
It's competence is supreme, the supreme
law of the land.
We're going to talk about that in more
detail in later lectures.
That's hori, that's excuse me, that's
vertical federalism, the, the central
government kind of above the states.
But federalism is also a, a horizontal
concept, the relationship of sister states
among themselves.
And, and the vertical and the horizontal
are connected.
Everything's connected in the
Constitution, but
Article Four focuses essentially on the
states.
And we've seen them before.
We've glimpsed them before.
Of course, powers generally not given to
Congress
under Article One are going to be left to,
to, to state legislatures, but Article
Four brings states front and center.
And not just states, but what about those
parts of the United States.
That aren't states, what about territories
for example?
Article Four is going to focus on that.
So, it's going to in part tell us how
united really are the states
horizontally as well as vertical, and it's
going to remind us that the United States
actually strictly speaking in compasses
more than stated.
For example, encompasses the national
seat, today known as Washington, DC.
That's not a state.
It's not represented in the House or the
Senate, but it's obviously part of the
United States.
It's, it's where basically the government
of the United States resides.
And so two territories are going to be and
always have been, part of the United
States.
And Article Four is going to focus on, and
front and center, and in this discussion
of Article Four, we're going to
see really the same great themes that
we've been glimpsing throughout our tour.
We're going to see the importance of
democracy in self-government another word
for a,
a, kind of a synonym, really,
for democracy, at the founding, was
republicanism.
The two are actually very similar as we're
going to talk about,
in the next lectures.
So, you're going to see themes of
democracies
slash republicanism, popular sovereignty,
popular self rule.
We're going to see the issue of slavery,
and the companion issue of race,
emerge yet again.
As we've been seeing it throughout.
And we're we saw it even in the question
like, who is the people?
We the people?
Who counts and who doesn't count?
Do free
blacks count?
Do slaves count?
And Article Four is going to tee that
issue up centrally.
So, democracy, self government, race and
slavery,
and the importance of national security
and
in Geography, and Geostrategy will be,
another thing that we see in Article Four.
Or, as we saw, that theme in the preamble
and in Articles One,
Two, and, and Three.
For example on Geography, recall that the
difference between the
Supreme Court and the lower Federal Courts
is basically that the
lower Federal Courts are geographically
distributed throughout the country whereas
the Supreme Court is going to be in the
National capital.
And in that difference you can actually
begin to understand
Marbury versus Madison which says you
can't expand the original jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court beyond the trial
jurisdiction, beyond what the
constitution provides and one idea is kind
of a geographic idea.
Certain things are supposed to be tried in
the nation
center, but other things are actually
supposed to be tried.
They can be buried in lower federal courts
and
these lower federal courts are going to be
picked.
They're judges, just like Supreme Court
Justices basically.
Nominated by the President, confirmed by
the Senate.
But they're going to sit in the
hinterlands in
the states rather than in the national
capital.
So, these themes of, of democracy and, and
and geography slash
Geostrategy, which we've which we've been
seeing, and slavery, and
race, which we've been seeing in, Articles
One, Two, and
Three, and in the Preamble, are also
evident in Article Four.
I'm going to come back
to this picture which begins chapter Seven
of America's Constitutional biography,
which is our, sort of, handbook for this
part of the course.
Every chapter begins, remember, with a
picture.
And if you understand the picture, you
really understand the deep ideas of the
chapter.
I'm going to come back to this picture at
the end of the next lecture.
But, to just to anticipate a bit, this a
picture in the beginning of chapter 7 is,
from, the
printer, Benjamin Franklin.
It's generally reckoned the first
political cartoon, maybe ever, Franklin
was a very inventive fellow.
Bifocals, the Franklin stove, the
lightning rod, He
could be given credit as having invented
the idea
of, of political cartoons, and this is
the, the first one.
It's from, 1754, way before the American
Revolution.
And, Ben Franklin is urging a kind of
union of sorts of the different colonies.
With the caption "join or die."
I'm going to come back to this again at
the end of the next lecture.
But, just to remind
you of how the United States begins.
It begins as a series of British colonies
in North America.
And, originally there, these colonies are
settled at different times.
Populated by different demographic groups.
so, folks from some
parts of England end up more in some parts
of the new world and from other parts
of, of the British empire and, and Europe
They end up in, in,
in, in other colonies.
So, they're not all kind of homogeneous
demographically.
They, they begin as these widely scattered
outposts on the Atlantic seaboard.
Founded at different times for different
purposes.
Sometimes by business ventures, seeking to
make a quick buck.
Others by the, the British monarchy
itself.
Still others, by, religious decenters and
others trying to sort of
escape, the old world and, and create, new
world,
self government as best they, they can.
while,
professing allegiance to the crown but
trying to the British crown, but trying to
preserve as much freedom as, as is, and
self-government as is possible.
Well, as these colonies grow and expand,
they start to verge on each other.
Borders sometimes get shifted around, but
the
colonies, you need to understand, are
legally distinct
from each other.
And, they're connected to the British
Crown, but not really quite to each other.
Imagine a kind of wheel with spokes from
each colony to
the same king, in, in the center, but not
much of a rim connecting.
The colonies to each other, in 1930, for
example, just to flash forward.
The British Empire, the British
Commonwealth, consists
of a whole bunch of different entities,
that they all have the same common crown,
but there not tightly connected to each
other, and you've got Kenya, and India,
and Ireland, and Canada, and New Zealand,
and
Australia, and they all have a common
crown, but not much connection to each
other.
That America,
in say the 1750's, and there are British
North American colonies to
the north and in Nova Scotia, and, and
Halifax, and, and to
the south in the West Indies, but and
Franklin, Ben Franklin
in 1754 thinks there should be kind of
more connection among the colonies.
He himself as a continentalist.
He's born in Massachussetts and
he at a young age with kind of pennies in
his pocket.
Just a young man setting out to make
his fortune, he, he leaves Massachusetts
goes to
New York briefly but ends up in
Philadelphia
where he does find fame and, and fortune.
and, but he's imaging the continentalist
that he is way before others are.
Because most other Americans actually
don't
leave their home colonies.
Most people in the, in the 18th Century
lived and died in a
50 mile radius, and many of them sort of
never ventured beyond that, that.
But, Franklin does, he's a continentalist,
and as early as the 1750's,
he's saying, we should create more of a
union among the colonies.
Still, in 1750's under the British
umbrella, but there
should be more connection actually across
these, these different colonies.
He proposes, there's a, there's a, a
meeting,
a gathering, a conclave a congress if you
will.
Among us some of the different colonies,
they meet in Albany, New York, in 1754.
And Franklin proposes a plan in which
the colonies together will regulate
intercolonial affairs.
They'll be a council, kind of like NATO or
the EEU.
And,
they'll regulate interstate affairs, and
they will control, and they
will regulate western territory and handle
continental defense and elect
a sort of a, and the King will, will pick
maybe a presiding officer, a Governor of
all the United Colonies.
And, this will all be under the, the, the
supervision
of Parliament and the crown, but the
individual colonial legislatures
aren't that interested in seeding power to
some, central, council
and, and Britain doesn't seem so
interested either in bringing all
these colonies together, because if you
bring them together, who
knows what will happen when they start
talking to each other.
Britain, so, Britain isn't so keen on it,
the colonial legislators
aren't, aren't so keen on it, so this idea
goes nowhere,
in the 1750's.
But see, Franklin the inventor, he's
trying
to, as it were, re-invent the wheel.
He's trying to create a new kind of wheel
that
won't just have spokes from the center to
the different colonies.
He's trying to add a rim to the wheels,
so the colonies will be more connected to
each other.
But this wheel, so Franklin is, so to
speak reinventing
the wheel, and, but the wheel goes nowhere
in the 1750's.
But, his ideas
become a model for the Articles
of Confederation, after Independence after
1776.
Now, 13 colonies have decided that
together they're going to, join hands,
and, and wage war, a war of, of
continental liberation against the crown.
So they're going to, they're in this
together and now they need some sort of
mechanism to coordinate their, their,
military
strategy, and their defense expenditures,
and
their foreign policy, their, their
treaties, visa via the rest of the world.
They're going to need more of a, a rim,
and some of Franklin's ideas
that he had floated in the 1750's have
come to the fore, actually.
And, and, and, one section of, of the
Articles of
Confederation, remember it's not so well
organized as a document.
Article Four of the articles of
confederation actually has some provisions
that become
with a little tweaking, and we'll pay
attention to some of those tweaks
but some of these provisions of Article
Four of the articles of confederation
that builds on Franklin's earlier model,
will
become Article Four of the US
Constitution.
So here's one idea,
that basically people like Franklin should
be able
to go from one state to another state.
Remember they're no longer colonies now
they're state.
They should be able to go from
Massachusetts to New
York to Pennsyvania as Franklin, as, as a
young man,
had gone from Massachusetts to New York to
Pennsylvania and
not be treated as aliens, not be treated
as outsiders.
So one idea is, that your
entitled as, as an American, to the priv
as an American citizen
to the privileges and immunities of
citizenship in other states.
So this idea that there should be
interstate privileges and immunities, a
free ingress egress.
We should be able to go from one state to
another.
In fact, maybe even relocate and move and
become a citizen of another state.
and, but even if you're just a visitor,
you
should be not you should be not
discriminated against.
You should be treated as a, an insider
rather than as an alien.
That's the idea.
Privilege, interstate privileges and
immunities of citizenship.
You see this in the EU today, for example.
You know, you should be able to get a job
in another country
in the EU and, and you shouldn't have to
have a passport to travel
from one EU nation to the other.
Well that's the idea of Article Four, that
the free mobility among the states and,
and, to treat citizens of one state as
insiders in another state.
Well, one important change that Article
Four of the constitution makes
is under the articles of confederation.
Poppers vag, and vagabonds and
were accepted from this so if you are poor
you
know a state could basically exclude you
out the boarder.
But Article Four gets rid of the
constitution, gets rid of that language.
So, now in the future a penniless
Ben Franklin, leaving Massachusetts to
make his, his
fortune in New York or in Pennsylvania
can't
be excluded, can't be barred at the gate.
So that's I think, a democratic
legalitarian, reform.
Another thing is that the constitution is
better worded it's Article Four on
privileges and
immunities than, than the Articles the
Confederation were,
Articles of Confederation were a little
bit confused.
Constitution, for example, is going to
make clear
that when it comes to naturalization of
foreigners,
people born abroad who come to the
United States, individual states shouldn't
have that power,
the central government should have that
power.
So, it shouldn't in the authority of any
one
state to make someone from Europe, for
example, an American.
That should be decided by the United
States rather than the individual states.
but, couple of questions.
One: Who exactly is a citizen?
In particular, what about, because there's
not quite
a definition, a clear definition of who is
a citizen.
In order to be president you have to be a
citizen of the
United States and member of the House or
the Senate of the United States.
But what does that mean?
And in particular can black people, free
black
people, not slaves, free black people be
citizens?
Well, I think the best read in the
constitution is yes they can be if their
state,
their home state recognizes their
citizenship.
Free blacks fought, at Bunker Hill, and
in, in Massachusetts.
And, voted for the constitution in, in
Massachusetts
and several other states at the founding
and were
treated completely equally, in several of
the states,
and Article Four does not use the word
white.
It could have used that word.
Actually, South Carolina wanted it to use
that
word, but South Carolina got out-voted on
that.
In the Articles of Confederation, in
implementing parts of
the Articles of Confederation, sometimes
the word, actually, white, was
used in some context, but not, in efforts
again to
implement the Articles of Confederation,
but not in the Constitution.
So, I think the best reading of Article
Four is it has no race
test and if it had actually the people
of Massachusetts would have been unhappy
with that.
They voted down, a Massachu, a proposed
state constitution in 1778.
Because it had some racial qualifications
and the
people of Massachusetts, in some places,
didn't like that.
They were offended by race tests.
But in the and, and so the, that word is
purposely omitted from the constitution.
but, in the 1850's, the Supreme Court,
which is going to be
popu, which is populated by justices
picked by presidents.
Presidents picked by an electoral college,
which leans
toward the south, because of the three
fifths clause.
This pro-southern Supreme Court presided
over by Roger Taney,
who replaces, succeeds John Marshall,
Taney is Andrew Jackson's man
he was put on the court he used to be
Jackson's cabinet, he's put on the court
by Andrew Jackson.
Taney in a case called Dred Scott in 1857
is going to say several things.
But,
one of the things he's going to say is
free Blacks can never be
citizens, even if they were born free
in Massachusetts and Massachusetts calls
them a citizen.
Even if their father, even if they vote
Massachusetts, even if their freeborn
father voted in
Massachusetts, even if their freeborn
grandfather voted on,
for the constitution and, and fought at
bunkers hill.
Taney says, no matter, free blacks, people
descended
from, Africa, can never be citizens of the
United States, never be
entitled to the privileges and immunities
of citizens of the United States.
Now, I think that was a mistaken reading.
And and it's going to precipitate The
Civil War.
Lincoln is going to have a strong reaction
to, other elements of Dred Scott.
Not so much that one, but other aspects of
Dred Scott.
And so in our next lecture we're going to,
talk a lot
more about race, and slavery, and how it
plays out throughout
art, Article Four and, is eventually
going to help us understand why
the early Constitution, this very
well-organized
Constitution ultimately fails in the
1860s.
So stay tuned.
