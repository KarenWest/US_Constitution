Welcome back.
The United States of America
is a vast and varied place, a place of
many languages.
Faiths, ethnic backgrounds and within this
land
the, the United States Constitution, the
written
constitution stands as a, as a uniquely
unifying symbol.
It's our Queen Elizabeth.
Our Taj Mahal.
Our Marseillaise.
But it's not the only text that, that
unifies us.
That, that, that is a prominent signal and
symbol
of, of what it means to, to be an
American.
It's not the only basic statement of the
American creed.
What I'd like to talk about in today's
lecture and, and the next one, are a set
of other texts that help constitute us.
That help to
bind us together as, as a, as a nation
with a constitutional culture.
So I'm going to talk about.
Six exemplary illustrative but not
exhaustive
examples of these additional iconic texts.
These that, that together help form a
symbolic constitution that supplements the
written Constitution that we keep coming
talking about but also, going beyond.
So I want to just play a little game with
you all.
I want you to try to think about which
texts about and we're talking about texts
here, not mere symbols.
We're not talking about flags, or
uniforms.
But, but, but, but written text that set
forth propositions, ideas rules and
principles that
are of almost the same status as, as the
Constitution.
Text that in some ways are, are connected
to the Constitution.
That are meditations on or reflections
of, embodiments of deep constitutional
principles.
These texts they can come from private
persons.
They can come from government different
branches of, of government.
They can be from the founding era.
They can could be from, from later
centuries.
But try to just think about if you had to
nominate
the most important texts that that you
unify us all
Republican and Democrat and liberal and
conservative, we would all claim these.
That people of all faiths.
So, not the Bible because that's, that,
that's
claimed by all faiths and that's not quite
a distinctive statement of what it means
to
be an American, but there are these other
texts.
So just, I'm going to give you about ten
seconds.
Just to try to think about what you might
nominate for inclusion on this,
as if, I can think of 20 or, off the
top of my head in this chapter that I'm
going to be
sharing with you today, and in the
following lecture, I'm going to
give you six illustrations and as I said,
they're only exemplary.
But, I'm going to give you a few seconds
now just to think about what you would
nominate for inclusion in this special
pantheon, of specially important,
iconic, constitutional text of some sort
that help constitute us, bind us
together as a nation, that these are the
things that Americans believe.
Okay.
Now and this, this is an experiment.
It could fail disastrously, but I'm
going to give you my
list, and let's see how it corresponds to
your list.
The six that I highlight are the
Declaration of Independence and the
Federalist Papers.
The Gettysburg Address.
Brown versus Board of Education, the case.
Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream
speech.
the, and, when they go around the co,
there's one more.
It's the Northwest Ordinance.
And when I go around the country and play
this game with audiences, I almost always
get when people just sort of toss out
their, their candidates.
In the first minute or so, I usually get.
The first five, the Federalist papers,
the Declaration of Independence, something
from Lincoln.
Some people say the Emancipation
Proclamation or the, the second
inaugural address or the first inaugural
address but something from Lincoln.
Often they say the Gettysburg Address.
So Federalist Papers, the Declaration of
Independence, the Gettysburg Address.
When I say well, pick a case, you know,
people will say Marbury or McCulloch,
but most of them will say Brown.
Those are the three big cases, sort of the
Mt.
Rushmore cases, and I say well pick
something from
a private citizen not just a government o,
official.
So we have something from President Abe
Lincoln.
We have something from a court, Brown.
Pick something from just an ordinary
American and people will say, you got
to have a dream speech or they'll say the
Federalist papers, which, of course,
also came from private pens.
So, when I play this game in the North and
the South and the East
and the West, when I play this grame,
game at,uh, before liberal audiences and
conservative audiences.
What's amazing is that I almost always get
the same nominations.
So you can test that against your own
intuitions.
Remember I gave you time to, to think
about your
list, but if I am right, that if basically
wherever
we play this game people come up with the
same.
answers.
And you can see, actually, some, me
playing this game
on YouTube if you want to just, you know,
click on YouTube.
I played it in Scranton, Pennsylvania
before one kind of audience.
I played it in Malibu, California.
Pepperdine University, a more conservative
law school.
Played this game, and and I, and I've done
it maybe half a dozen times elsewhere
that haven't been captured on YouTube, but
I always get the same nominations.
So if that's true, here's something really
amazing, and this, the
first of the three big points I want to
make today.
We do have a symbolic constitution.
It exists and
the proof of that, the existence proof is
that people
North and South, East and West, liberal
and conservative, all converge
on the declaration of Independence and the
Gettysburg Address, and the
I Have a Dream Speech, and Brown, and the
Federalist papers.
They may offer some ones that are sort of
similar to, to, to this.
They, they might say, as I said the
Emancipation Proclamation.
They might of picked another iconic case,
McCulloch, or, or Marbury.
But, we do have a, a set of texts that,
that help bind us together.
That constitute us.
That define the American creed.
This is what we Americans believe in.
Some people propose novels but, but
there's a little
bit more range on, novels with the great
American novelists.
Huck Finn, is it The Great Gatsby see some
people
on the conservative side might like Ayn
Rand.
You know others might prefer John
Steinbeck or
Upton Sinclair, so and, and novels aren't
quite propositional
statements the way some of these other
texts really
say, here's what the American creed is all
about.
Here's what we the people of America
believe, what we are committed to.
so.
First claim.
These texts exist as having special
normative force.
Special authority in our constitution
culture.
In the next lecture I'm going to talk a
little
bit about what that constitutional
authority is just to anticipate.
I do not claim these texts are exactly the
same as the written constitution.
They're
not.
When the written constitution is clear, it
trumps, but sometimes it's not so clear,
and where the written constitution is not
so clear, my claim is that these adjoining
texts help clarify the meaning of the
written text.
And they, they help us identify
which particular reading of the written
constitution.
Where the written constitution is
ambiguous
will ultimately prev, prevail.
Which, which version of the written
constitution's possible interpretations
we're going to embrace.
That these texts help us make those
decisions.
Whether consciously or unconsciously,
these are the adjoining texts that,
that anchor and support, that supplement,
that buttress the written Constitution.
So there
is a thing called an symbolic
constitution.
It's one of many elements of our unwritten
constitution.
It's not, it's not like just
how ordinary Americans live their lives
unselfconsciously.
We, you know, play the fiddle and we have
pet dogs, and, you know, that was an
earlier chapter.
No.
These are texts that we all read together
and embrace that have propositions.
So it's a different kind of unwritten
constitution.
Say then.
The lived constitution.
But both of the lived constitution and
this one are elements of our national
identity.
Who we are as a people.
Sometimes we just do things
unselfconsciously.
We live our lives.
But this is more part of our own more
reflective
understanding of our American identity,
our constitutional identity.
So the first point is, there is such a
thing as an, as a symbolic constitution.
It's composed of certain key texts and
that there is actually
quite, there's a canon so to speak, canon,
a sort of a, a body.
Of, of particular works that are of
special significance.
And that there's great convergence about
which things actually are at the
center of the canon.
And there's a little less focus on the
Northwest Ordinance.
I'll defend that nomination of mine.
But the other five, basically almost
wherever I go.
On the Northwest Ordinance, if I'm in the
Midwest, a lot of people undersand it.
If, if they're not from the Midwest, they
may not.
Appreciate its significance.
But, if, if you're from Indiana or
Illinois or
Ohio or Wisconsin or Minnesota, Michigan
then the Northwest
ordinance takes on perhaps special
significance to you.
You recognize that more often than not.
So here is a
second point about this unwritten
constitution
of specially im, important symbolic texts.
They are connected to each other in all
sorts of interesting ways.
They form a system,
a network.
So the Gettysburg Address begins by
alluding to the Declaration of
Independence.
Four score and seven years ago.
Do the math.
Lincoln is saying that at Gettysburg 1863,
four score and
seven is 87.
You subtract 87 from 1863 and you do the
math, 1776, not the Constitution, the
Declaration of Independence.
Four score and seven years ago, our
fathers brought forth, upon this
continent, a new
nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to
the proposition that all men are created
equal.
A direct quote from the Declaration of
Independence.
So, right out of the gate, Lincoln is
alluding to
the Declaration of Independence.
There they are connected.
Martin King where is he speaking when he
give that I Have a Dream speech?
In front of the Lincoln Memorial.
He connecting and, and he's doing it and
here's how he begins.
Five score years ago, a great American in
whom symbolic
shadow we stand today because he, he's
speaking this in 1963.
Exactly 100 years after the, the
Gettysburg Address.
And then later on, so he's, he right outta
the gate is alluding
to the Gettysburg Address and to Lincoln,
in whose shadow he's giving this speech.
And then he soon comes enough to
soon enough comes to the Declaration of
Independence.
i, i, itself.
And, and invokes the Declaration of
Independence, life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness and the idea that all
men are created equal.
Let's take the the
Northwest Ordinance.
Not only are these, these texts actually
connected.
Interestingly, they're almost all
connected to two men.
Thomas Jefferson and Abe Lincoln.
Thomas Jefferson writes the Declaration of
Independence.
The first draft he's the lead author.
He's also the lead author of the first
draft of the Northwest Ordinance.
His political
ally and partner his, his tag team ticket
in
partner is, is James Madison.
Together they will later.
Found the what they call the Republican
Party, that's now the, the Democrat Party.
And who succeed, who's Jefferson's
Secretary of State and successor?
It's James Madison.
They're this tag
team, Madison and Jefferson.
Well, Jefferson's tag team partner,
Madison,
is a coauthor of the Federalist Papers.
So Jefferson's connected to the
Declaration of Independence.
He's the author of the first draft of the
Northwest Ordinance.
His, you know, political ally is the
coauthor of the Federalist Papers.
Lincoln of course is the most famous
inhabitant of the Northwest, that,
that Northwest territory.
He grows up in the Northwest and, and he
gives the Gettysburg Address of course.
And and Dr. King is going to you know,
echo Lincoln himself
and speak in, literally in Lincoln's
shadow at the Lincoln Memorial.
Brown vs Board of Education is authored
by Earl Warren a Republican, party of
Lincoln.
All the other members of the Brown court
are, are Democrats, party of
Jefferson, and here in fact we get close
to the nub of the thing.
One of the reasons that Jefferson and,
and, and Lincoln are so important is that
they are the patron saints, they are the
founders basically of our two great
political parties.
And that's why they're up
there on Mount Rushmore.
The process ours is a two-party system.
That's part of our unwritten and written
Constitution,
I'm going to argue in a later chapter.
Two-party system is deeply intertwined in,
into the American constitutional system.
That, I know that's different than what
some of you have been taught, but
I'm going to try to make that case in a
few weeks a later lecture.
And and
the very processes by which certain folks
have come
to be heroes in American history are
partisan processes.
If you're a member of one party
Jefferson's your guy.
And you're going to actually promote the
Declaration of Independence as important.
Because you like Jefferson.
So that was actually a political process
that helped
raise the visibility of the Declaration of
Independence When Jefferson
sought about to become President.
It was sort of part of his cam, his
campaign.
Vote for Jefferson, he's the Declaration
of Independence guy and
so part of that is propping up the
Declaration of Independence.
If you're a Republican in the 1860s.
You know, you want to convince people this
war has been worth it, because
there've been so many people killed, the
Gettysburg Address is kind of your
platform.
It makes the case that all this has been
worth it, the gov, what was at stake was
nothing
less than the fate of republican
government, of government of
the people, by the people, for the people,
on the Earth.
If that's what the stakes were, that this
is worth it.
So the Gettysburg Address is something
that you're
going to sort of latch onto and, and
promote.
When time comes to put to decide who's
going to be up there on
Mount Rushmore, one party wants Jefferson
up
there, the other party wants Lincoln up
there.
George Washington you see is, towers
above.
parties.
He's a pre-party person but those three
big
figures, Mount Rushmore is part of
America's symbolic constitution.
It's an icon.
It's like our Eiffel Tower or our
Taj Mahal, our Marseillaise, our, our
Queen Elizabeth.
So, just talk about the Mount Rushmore
Presidents, to talk
about the, the folks who are at, at the
top.
Of the American in, in the center of the
American pantheon.
And parties have been a big part of that.
That's why it's Jefferson and Lincoln
along side Washington as sort of.
The big three.
So the first point is that these There
is a symbolic constitution and there's
wide spread agreements.
In all parts of the country.
All ideologies.
Everyone claims
the Declaration of Independence Everyone
claims that they believe in Brown v.
Board of Education.
There's different interpretations of what
Brown means.
But everyone says, oh but we've believe in
Brown, liberals and conservatives.
Republicans and Democrats everyone says,
yeah we're with Lincoln.
And the Gettysburg Address that, that
speaks for us.
So their first point is that it exists and
everyone claims it.
And the second point is that these, these
texts actually interestingly
connect up to each other in all sorts of
ways they form a system.
A mesh work.
Of, of meaning, it's not random at all.
And my third point today is that they,
these texts connect up
to the written Constitution in various
subtle ways and the American people.
The American people have ratified each of
these texts and made each of these texts
a some a text of a special constitutional
significance So, I'm going to tell
you little bit about how in effect, these
texts connect to the written constitution.
And then in the next lecture, I'll give
you some specific
examples of, of what follows from the fact
that we have this.
Symbolic constitution that's
interconnected and
that connects to the written constitution.
So, so
what?
What does that mean?
How, how is that going to be useful for me
in understanding the Constitution in
making or evaluating constitutional
arguments?
That's the next lecture.
But, but just, to show you the
connections, of course.
So, we have the Declaration of
Independence is drafted in Independence
Hall.
The very same room where later on people
are going to purpose the Constitution.
So connections between these two iconic
documents
from the very beginning they, they both
emerge from that,
that, that hall in Philadelphia that we
now call Independence Hall.
They sit side by side with each other in
the National Archives.
The parchment versions of these documents.
So, they've, they've been linked from the
very beginning and the
Constitution claims to really be the
fulfillment of the Declaration of
Independence.
The Declaration of Independence said, you
know, King George has
violated all these rights, and the
government exists to secure
certain rights and when government no
longer secures these rights.
It's the right of the people to alter and
abolish government and reform it, in
order to preserve their rights and so
the Constitution says, we are altering and
abolishing.
The Constitution says, we, the people of
the United States are altering or
abolishing,
and abolishing, to some extent, the
Articles
of Confederation, and we're changing our
state constitutions
in order to preserve our rights and, and,
and, and pursue our
happiness and though, so the Constitution
claims to be a fulfillment.
Of the Declaration of Independence.
And the Federalist
Papers are of course a meditation on the
written constitution.
They're and they're a reminder.
So you say well
there are other meditations.
Why is this so significant?
Well I'll give you a political
explanation.
You, et, both Hamilton, who's a Federalist
and Madison,
who's a who is a Republican are connected
with this.
So both political parties early on, before
we have
Democrats and Republicans, we have
Federalist and the Jeffersonians.
And Madison's a Jeffersonian and Hamilton
is a Federalist.
So both parties can kind of claim credit
for the Federalist Papers.
Other so, defenses of the Constitution,
for example
James Wilson, who, was one of six people,
along
with Ben Franklin and a few others, to
have
signed both the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution.
He's a very, iconic figure, founder of the
University of Pennsylvania
Law School, one of the first justices on
the Supreme Court.
He writes the words We the People.
He's a very important figure, but he's
connected with
the Federalist party a little too much, so
you hear
less about him than you hear about the
Federalist
Papers, because both parties can claim the
Federalist Papers.
Both the Hamiltonians and the
Jeffersonians.
And it's a deep mediation on the
Constitution.
It's systematic.
It's holistic.
It offers an account of the, the whole
document.
and, in that way it's much better than
many
of the other commentaries which are kind
of partial.
It's written down.
And the Supreme Court, for example, has
cited the Federalist in no fewer than 300
cases.
100 just in the decade of the 1990s alone.
And that's just the number of cases, not
the number of cites.
In one particular case for example I
believe
it's from the 1990s, a case called Prince
the court of the justices on, on the court
I think cited to the, the Federalist
in this one single case I think.
More than 60 times and again, over 300
cases all
total, 100 just in the 1990s, it's of
special constitutional significance.
And, and, this goes all the way back to
the days of John Marshall, who very early
on
identified the Federalist Papers as, as
having particular importance
in trying to understand the meaning of the
Constitution.
The Northwest Ordinance.
It has some very famous language in it,
that slavery nor involuntary servitude,
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
shall exist
except as a punishment for a crime.
Now, you've heard that language before
because that's
word-for-word what later will become the
13th Amendment.
The anti-slavery amendment.
Lincoln's amendment.
Lincoln's from the Northwest.
And he believes in, in an end to slavery.
And finally when he
wins re-election, and his party wins
re-election,
they propose a 13th Amendment to end
slavery.
And what language did they use to codify
this end to slavery?
Language of the Northwest Ordinance.
A lot of the people who give you the
the Union vision, the Republican vision,
are from the Northwest.
From Ohio and Illinois.
People like Ulysses S.
Grant and, and William Tecumseh Sherman
and, and,
and Abe Lincoln.
That's the backbone of the Republican
party, these Northwesterners.
John Bingham, from Ohio.
And, in the 13th Amendment, there's
actually an inscribing
of the Northwest Ordinance's vision into
the written Constitution itself.
The 14th Amendment comes along and says
everyone is born an equal citizen.
Well what is that?
That's the textualization of Lincoln's
idea
that the central proposition is that we're
all created equal.
He in turn is borrowing from Jefferson,
and so with the 14th
Amendment we have a kind of
textual codification of Lincoln's loss on
Jefferson.
Jefferson himself, of course, was a
slaveholder.
Died a slaveholder.
I don't know, it's kind of complicated.
What he really thought those words, all
men are created equal, meant.
But we know what Lincoln thought it meant.
And he thought deep down it meant that
slavery must end.
That he really, that all men really, and
women, really
were created equal and the 14th Amendment
textualizes that idea.
The first sentence of the 14th Amendment
which uses the word born.
Everyone born in the United States is born
a citizen.
And therefore an equal citizen.
We see that new birth of freedom
that Lincoln talked about in the
Gettysburg Address.
Now actually textualized in the
idea of equality at birth.
Birth equality Which is Lincoln's gloss on
Jefferson.
That's now in the text of the
Constitution.
The 13th and the 14th and the
15th Amendments are actually can textual
ratifications
of Lincoln's vision, even though they're
all
eventually ratified after Lincoln has been
assassinated.
The 13th is proposed when Lincoln
is still alive, but, but ratified after.
So these, these Brown versus
Board of Education is of course this
absolutely central text.
It's the mediation on the meaning of the
word equal
in the Constitution as is the I Have a
Dream speech.
So each of these texts is connected in
a very direct way to the actual
Constitution.
And when and shortly after the I Have A
Dream speech, we get voting, a civil
rights act, and an voting rights act, and
voting rights amendments that protect the
right to vote.
We have a, an anti-poll tax amendment, and
a, and
a young adult voting amendment, the 24th
and the 26th.
These are textual codifications of a
vision that That Dr. King puts forth.
We, we may, we, we ratify his vision, we
the
people, when we make when we have a
national holiday
in his name, just as we ratify the
Declaration of
Independence when we have a national
holiday to commemorate July 4th.
Independence itself was actually declared
on July 2nd, 1776.
What happened on July 4 was the adoption
of this text.
This Declaration of Independence that
Jefferson lead authored and, and
that's the day we celebrate.
We celebrate this particular text not just
the fact of independence but the reasons
why.
The constitutive, the constitutional
statement
of what Americans actually believe in.
We hold these truths to be self evident.
So just to conclude this lecture, there is
a symbolic constitution.
It consists of specially important
constitutive iconic texts that everyone
embraces and pretty much people converge.
It exists that, that on what are the
central elements of that.
And all of these texts actually are part
of the system.
They talk to each other.
They connect to each other.
And each of them is connected in some very
approximate way to
the words of the written constitution
itself and to the larger American culture.
Now, in the next
lecture, I'm going to go through some of
these individual elements,
these, these six special texts, and, and
tell you a
little bit about, well, what might it mean
that these
actually form an unwritten symbolic
constitution that supplements the written
one?
So we'll do that, and of course I'll have
to tell you about the picture.
So stay tuned.
