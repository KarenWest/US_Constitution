Welcome back.
In our previous sessions, we've been
talking about article two of the
constitution.
The executive branch, the Presidency.
And we're going to continue that
conversation,
for the next couple of sessions.
We started talking about numbers that, at
first you
might not notice, but actually contain
very interesting stories.
The number four, a Presidency is a
four-year term.
And at
the founding, that was unprecedented.
No governor had a four-year term, only New
York had a three-year term.
But today, 48 of the governors, of the 50
governors actually have four-year terms,
because their governships have
begun to be modeled, have been, in fact,
modeled
on the American presidency in all sorts of
ways.
We talked about the number zero.
Zero property qualifications in order to
be president.
Unlike property qualifications that
existed for most governorships of the,
all the governorships really, at the time
the Constitution was adopted.
No governorships today, and when you think
about the fact that
the Constitution creates a strong
presidency open to low born persons.
It's pretty remarkable when you remember
that
in England, the chief of that the head
of, a state is anything but lowborn.
He's he's a, a monarch, to the throne
born.
But in America, folks born in very modest
circumstances have become president
because of, because of that invisible
number, what's not fair property
qualification zero.
Andrew Jackson, lowborn.
Ulysses S Grant.
Harry Truman.
Ronald Reagan.
Gerald
Ford.
Bill Clinton.
Barack Obama.
Now some of these folks, had acquired some
modest fortunes by
the time they became presidents see, but
not all of them.
Not, for example, Bill Clinton or Barack
Obama or, or others, so that's pretty
extraordinary.
Think about another zero.
Zero religious qualifications in order to
be president.
Again, something that's not fair.
When we, when we look at the,
the, the, the terse text, the written
Constitution, you
want to focus on what's there, and what's
not there.
No, religious, qualifications, to be,
president.
Whereas almost state governorship except
for Virginia, had a religious test.
Two of the four folks up there
on Mt.Rushmore Jefferson and Lincoln, not
members of
not church goers in organized
denominational sets
at the time of their, their elections.
They're two of the four are kind of not
conventional church goers.
Two of the four presidents up there on
Mt.Rushmore.
Think about the last presidential
election.
The constitution was created by a group of
largely white Protestants.
Mainstream Protestants of the four people
running for
the presidency and the vice presidency
last time around.
Mitt Romney was, was, is a white
Protestant, but of a, and a member
of a, of a, of a denomination that didn't
even exist at the founding.
Mormonism, a kind of, a, a new
denomination.
Paul Ryan and Joe Biden, both Catholics.
The only mainstream Protestant, Barack
Obama, non-white.
Father a Muslim from Africa.
And so, dramatic
possibilities, democratic possibilities,
egalitarian possibilities,
simply from what not in the constitution,
the zero, the no religious
qualifications.
We talked about another number that, that
really is in the constitution if you look
carefully, in the executive branch.
In article two, if you look carefully,
three fifths.
The three fifths clause was built in to
not just the apportionment
of the House of Representatives, but also
the structure of the Electoral College.
And that's going to give, actually,
Southern slave
holding states, a big leg up in the
Presidential sweepstakes because they're
going to count, be able
to count their slaves, for extra electoral
votes.
Remember, an anti-slavery rule
wouldn't have been one, count slaves just
like everyone else.
Equality, no.
The question wasn't you know, whether
slaves were going to vote.
Of course they weren't going to vote.
The question's how much extra cloud slave
states
were going to get in the House of
Representative and
Electoral College, because the existence
of slavery, and three
fifths basically meant they were going to
get extra cloud.
So so,
the number zero the number three-fifths,
the number four.
I want to remind you of one other number
that we talked about, the number one.
There's one president at any given time.
It's a, it's a very personal office.
A very lonely office, a singular office.
And is always in session, 24/7, 365.
Some more numbers.
Now you might
think well, what about the Vice
Presidency.
Is, is the President really as, as lonely
as, as you've just said, professor.
Remember that at the founding under
article two, actually presidents and vice
presidents
don't run as teams, as tickets under the
original article two of the Constitution.
The person who's vice president, simply
the person who comes in second
in the presidential sweepstakes.
George Washington won the, the presidency,
and John Adams came in second in the
presidential contest, both in 1789 and
then again in the reelection process.
So, the idea of, of a president and vice
president sort of teaming up as being part
of a ticket is going to emerge a little
bit later on as political parties come
on to the scene and are blessed by
a modification of article two, the twelfth
amendment.
And we're going to talk about that in
later lectures so, stay tuned.
But, for now, just recognize that, that
presidents and vice presidents of
the founding aren't necessarily teammates
working together intimately.
George Washington actually didn't rely
very much on, on, on John Adams
in his ad, administration, but the very
existence of the vice presidency does
confirm this idea of 24/7/365.
The presidency is always in session, you
always have to have a president.
There are many months of the year that
congress isn't in session.
The courts may go out of session, but you
always have to have a president
because executive power is continuous and
seamless.
The Presidency never sleeps.
And that's why the nanosecond that a, one
President dies or resigns,
the Vice President, the understudy,
seamlessly comes in to fill the breach.
That's not true in the House of
Representatives for example.
If a representative resigns or dies, you
have to wait for a new election.
In the Senate, if a senator dies or
resigns the
governor can pick a replacement but that's
going to take some time.
and, and the rules changed a little bit
after the Seventeenth Amendment.
We'll talk about that in later lectures.
And by the way, why the governor?
Because in states, the governor was
going to be continuously in office and
the state legislature might be in session
or might not be in session.
So even at the state level, this idea of
executive power being continuous
was kind of built into the Constitution,
if you read very carefully.
So, the importance of an executive
understudy, of a number two,
who can at any instant, just step up an,
and, and
fill breach created by a presidential
death or resignation, is an
important element of, of the nature of the
executive power, American style.
The seamlessness, the continuity of,
of executive power.
Now the Constitution, article two also
provides,
because, it's so important to have a
precedent at every moment, the
constitution also
provides that if both the President and
the
Vice President are somehow out of action,
dead or disabled have left office
in a, in a resignation, that Congress by
law, can provide for a line of succession.
now, today, the speaker of the house is
under a statute
that's been passed in the, in the 1940's,
next after the vice
presidency and the president pro tem of
the senate after the speaker but
not at all clear, defines actually what
the constitution contemplated.
The Constitution says that the Congress is
supposed to designate an officer to
succeed
a vacant Presidency, Vice Presidency.
And it's not at all clear that members
of the legislature are officers, in the
relevant constitutional sense.
At least that's what James Madison argued,
way back
in the 1790s, when Congress passed the
first succession statute.
That first successions statute put
legislative leaders, senate
leaders and house leaders in the line of
succession.
And Madison said no, no, no, officers, by
officers
we meant Cabinet Officers.
Folks in effect who had been hand picked
by
the President to, to succeed him, not
legislative leaders.
And in fact there's another provision in
the Constitution that
says that law makers, legislators, can not
be Executive Officers.
In England, in a parliamentary system,
you've got, members
of parliament who are also part of the
cabinet.
You've got a
prime minister, the, the head of the
executive
branch, who is also a sitting member of
parliament.
But the Constitution in article one
actually
says Senators and Representatives can't be
officers.
So the minute, for example, Senator
Hillary Clinton is asked to
become Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
she has to leave the Senate.
Senator Salazar is asked to become
Cabinet Secretary Salazar.
Senator Kerry is asked to become Cabinet
Secretary Kerry.
These folks have to leave the Senate
because of
a thing called the incompatibility clause
in the Constitution.
You can't, in America, this is a feature
of American-style separation of
powers, be a member of both the
legislature and the executive branch.
And so Madison said, now listen, how's
this going to work?
You know, you can't simultaneously
be Speaker of the House and President,
both ends of, of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Signing bills and then deciding, as
Speaker of the House,
and then deciding whether to veto them or
not as president.
So, so, it doesn't really make sense
Madison argued,
for sitting lawmakers to be your, your
caretaker presidents.
And if they have to step down from the
legislature,
in order to be president Madison said,
well then you know,
why not actually have Cabinet officers do
that because they would be part
of the administration, hand picked by the
persons who had actually vacated the
office.
Again, this idea of executive power as
very indivualistic.
We, we vote for a person, as President and
if that person can't be President why not
have someone that person has hand picked,
their
Secretary of State for example carry on
their mandate.
In a world of political parties, Madison's
ideas I think,
actually became even more powerful because
if you vote for
Republicans as George W Bush and Dick
Chaney, you shouldn't
end up if disaster strikes, with a
Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
You know, if you vote for, for Ronald
Reagan
and George HW Bush, you shouldn't end up
with
Tip O' Neill.
If you vote for Barrack Obama and, and Joe
Biden, you shouldn't ever end up with,
with John Boehner.
So we're going to come back to that in, in
later in later lectures, but for now,
the very existence of a vice presidency
confirms
the unitary and continuous nature of
executive power.
And so does the provision for succession
in the event of double
death or double disability.
Now the, the unique personal nature of
executive power is also there if we
look carefully at some other words in
article two specifying the Presidential
Oath of Office.
There's not that much in the Constitution
about the Presidency and yet
word for word the framers of
the Constitution specified the, the
Presidential oath.
They,
that's the signal, they took oaths very
seriously, and they wanted, to
us to get a clear picture of what the
Presidency is all about.
I, do solemnly swear that I will
faithfully
execute the Office of President of the
United States
and will, to the best of my ability,
preserve,
protect, and defend the Constitution of
the United States.
Okay, now I, do solemnly
swear, the Constitution begins we do, and
now here
we see actually the singular, I do
solemnly swear.
So it's a very personal office.
You know, I do solemnly swear that I will,
to the best of my ability.
It's a very personal office.
And let's, let's take those words and
again try to
look at what's there, and not there,
understand them in context.
What's not there?
I don't have to swear any religious test.
Some presidents have chosen to add the
words, so
help me God, after the constitutionally
prescribed oath of office.
Almost all the presidents in the twentieth
century have done so.
and, and in the twenty first century.
But those words aren't in the
Constitution, they're a
personal choice, that a person can add or
not at.
Now, in the
state constitutions there actually were
religious oaths that needed to
be sworn by, by people before they could
become governor.
In England you had to, if you, the, the,
the coronation oath required
the, the, the monarch to swear to be
defender of the faith.
The oath had to be administered by a, an
Anglican Bishop or Arch Bishop.
Not so in the presidential oath.
Doesn't, doesn't specify any religious
trappings.
You can use a bible if you want but you
don't have to.
In England, you had to use a bible for the
Monarch's coronation oath.
And, and not just any bible.
It had to be a Protestant Bible.
Basically the King James Bible,
not the Duoay Catholic bible.
So, England had all sorts of religious
elements to its oath of office but for the
press, for the the,
the monarchy, but not for America's
presidency, sort of a, a secular office.
And what do you, what do you swear or
affirm, actually, you don't even
have to swear, if you have a
religious objection to swearing oaths, you
can affirm.
I do affirm that I will faithfully execute
the office of president of the United
States, and will to the best of
my ability preserve, protect, and defend
the constitution
of, of the United States.
You're not defender of the faith.
You're not even a defender of each and
every statute that Congress passes.
You are a defender of the constitution.
Now, what does that mean?
In England, after the Glorious Revolution
of 1688, 89, when kings were
designed, were supposed to be limited,
they, so that they wouldn't just rule by
executive fiat because no one had picked,
no one had elected them.
In England monarchs pledged to follow
Parliamentary laws.
The emergence after the Glorious
Revolution of Parliamentary sovereignty
and the executive branch pledged to, to
enforce every parliamentary statute.
The Presidential Oath doesn't quite read
that way.
It says I will defend the Constitution.
And maybe, statutes that had been passed
by the legislature
might be unconstitutional, and then what's
an oath-bound president to do?
And I think if we read the oath carefully,
that oh, the president is supposed to
defend the constitution
even at the expense of a statute, because
in
America, there's the idea that the
statutes might be unconstitutional.
because the Constitution comes from the
people themselves, and the Legislature,
the Congress is just one branch of
government under the Constitution.
That's not how it works in England.
In England, Parliament itself is
sovereign.
It's the, the highest body.
It, it's in effect the, the British
people, and anything that it, enacts,
is the highest law, and there's nothing
quite higher than an act of Parliament.
At least in, in the British constitutional
understanding
of the time of the, of the framing.
So, so when Parliament passes a law,
that's the highest
law of the land and monarchs are supposed
to unwaveringly enforce
that no matter what, even if the law for
example,
violates religious rights or suppresses
free speech, or does other things.
Monarchs are suppose to enforce, in
England the
laws of Parliament.
But in America, the president is suppose
to defend the constitution.
And if the legislature violated the
Constitution by passing a statute that
suppresses free speech, or goes beyond
Congresses enumerated powers, or
take property without just compensation
after a, the adoption of a
Bill of Rights, or it deprives people of a
jury trial, or
the like the President is supposed to
defend the Constitution and not the
statute.
So an important difference and how might a
President do that?
One easy and obvious way from the
beginning is to veto
a bill that is presented to him, if he
thinks it's unconstitutional.
So even if the House thinks the law is
constitutional,
and even if the Senate thinks the law is
constitutional,
a bill is constitutional, that doesn't end
the thing.
The president should simply say no and
veto the bill.
So, so, measuring constitutionality in the
American system
is not simply and only the province of
judges.
It's diffused more broadly.
If the House thinks it's unconstitutional,
they should just vote no.
The Senate thinks it's unconstitutional,
they should just vote no,
and they can prevent the thing from even
becoming a law.
But if they both pass it, the President
can
veto it, and indeed early presidents used
their veto pens overwhelmingly in
constitutional situations.
Of the, the first 50 vetoes, let's say,
roughly, be in the, in the
pre-civil war period, half of them were
constitutionally-based vetoes.
Vetoes, where the President send to these,
veto message saying, I think this bill is,
is not merely bad policy, but is
affirmatively unconstitutional.
So about, say two dozen, 24 of, of the 50
early vetoes of the president are
constitutional vetoes, based on
the president's constitutional oath of
office to defend the, to
preserve, protect and defend the
constitution of the United States.
By contrast, in that entire period, before
the Civil War,
basically the Supreme Court has
invalidated we'll
say even before 1850, they've invalidated
one statue
using a thing called judicial review that
we'll talk about in, in later lectures.
So, it's a case, 1803, Marbury versus
Madison.
So one judicial invalidation 24
presidential
vetoes based on the, on constitutional
objections.
And many of these vetoes are vetoing laws
that courts have upheld already or would
uphold.
We'll talk about that a little bit more
in our next lecture, when I actually tell
you a little bit about the next
picture that I want you to focus on which
is a picture of Andrew Jackson.
All about, actually, this picture.
It's going to be all about his veto power
and his relationship to the supreme court.
But in early Ameri-, in the in the early
constitutional experience, presidents are
defenders of the constitution, every bit
as much as courts, arguably more so.
In our next session, we're going to talk
about some other presidential powers that
intersect
with and reinforce the veto power that
we've just been, been, been talking about.
And I'm going to walk you through the next
picture in in our series.
Remember, every chapter of the book,
America's Constitution: A Biography, has a
picture.
That picture tells a story.
We talked about Washington's picture.
The picture of the Washington family in
our previous lectures, and in
the next one we are going to talk about
the picture of Andrew Jackson.
And if you understand that picture, you
will understand the antebellum presidency.
See you then.
