Welcome back to our grand tour of
America's unwritten Constitution
a set of, tools and techniques of going
beyond the written Constitution, beneath
it, behind it, beyond it.
Yet nevertheless remaining faithful to it.
And we've talking about different ways of
doing that.
We've talked about how we need to read the
Constituton as a whole.
There's no clause that specifically
directs us to do that.
There's no clause that says we shouldn't
and
the constitution was of course ratified as
a whole.
And in one of the most famous cases ever
decided.
The case of McCullough v Maryland, John
Marshall very famously reminds us, we
must never forget, he said, that it is a
constitution we are expounding.
That is, an entire document, not a clause,
not, not a word but
a constitution, a system.
And so, we began this guided tour by
talking about the
need to, to read the Constitution
holistically, seeing larger principles:
separation of
powers, checks and balances, limited
government,
federalism, the rule of law, the
idea that no man should be a judge in his
own case.
We talked about another technique, about
looking
at how the constitution was in fact
ordained, the process by which it was
enacted and seeing if there were deep and
important principles in that processes, as
indeed, there
were principles of free speech and
majority rule.
And late when we focused on how the
Constitution was in fact amended, the
particular processes
by which it was amended we see other
principles very significant in our system,
like the,
the Principle of a robust, republican
government,
a principle of the heart, of the
14th amendment, and the way it actually
came about, the way it was enacted.
[COUGH] Excuse me.
We talked about America's lived
constitution, a set of, of principles of
un-, unwritten Constitutional rights that
Americans
have embodied just by living out their
lives in ordinary ways, un-self conscious
ways.
But in, in the process of living out their
lives, they've embodied
certain basic rights, with-, without even
thinking about it very much: the right
to have a dog to play the fiddle, to wear
a hat, to enjoy
family life with your loved ones and to,
to raise your children.
We talked about looking at the
Constitution through the prism of case
law.
In particular the case law of the Warren
court.
The case law is not, itself a part
of this written constitution; this, this
terse text.
I'm reaching here in my pocket top pull it
out.
I've always got at least one copy.
Okay.
So this is the terse text; this is the
written constitution.
Case law, all of the judicial decisions,
they're not formally part
of this.
They're part of an as, as it were, an
unwritten constitution.
But they offer a set of, of lenses, a, a
prism through which, of course, we read
the terse text.
And that's what we talked about in our
discussion of
the Warren court and the role of precedent
more generally.
We talked about the world that
certain special text, constitutive texts,
constitutional texts,
if you will, outside the formal written
Constitution.
We talked about the role that some of
these
special iconic texts play in our national
constitutional culture.
Texts like the Declaration of Independence
and the, I Have a Dream
speech, and the Brown v Board of Education
case, and the Gettysburg Address.
I ended the last chapter by reminding you
that that Lincoln
is in, in my phrase, da man.
We very much live in Lincoln's
Constitution,
not just the founders', but Lincoln's
Constitution.
And we, in all sorts of ways, conscious
and unconscious, read the Constitution
from a Lincolnian perspective.
And then I said, okay, if Lincoln is the
man then what about women?
What about the ladies?
And by
the ladies I want to remind you, actually,
of a
famous letter that, that Abigail Adams
wrote to John Adams, her
husband in 1776, in which she very
famously urged John
Adams and his fellow revolutionaries to
quote, remember the ladies, unquote.
I'm going to come back to that at the end
of next
lecture, tell you a little bit more about
that letter that Abigail
wrote to John.
But let's take that admonition seriously.
Let's remember the ladies and see how that
a-, admonition plays
into Am-, America's constitutional culture
written and unwritten.
So here's a key fact about the written
Constitution.
It describes itself as in the Preamble, as
having been ordained and
established by the people.
And later on in Article Six, it
again refers to itself, this Constitution,
just as
it does in the Preamble, and it says, this
Constitution is the the supreme law.
So the Preamble says this Constitution is
ordained, this,
this written text is ordained and
established by the people.
and then later on in Article Six it
says this Constitution, again, this text,
is the supreme
law of the land.
And these two patches of text where the
document refers to itself, they're not the
only two
patches, but these two in particular, are
linked
it seems to me, by a theory of legitimacy.
A theory of popular sovereignty the Con-,
this
constitution is the supreme law of the
land
because it was ordained and established by
the
people in a process that was particularly
inclusive,
that involved more people than anything
ever
before in the history of planet Earth.
that, that, and, and a very wide swath of
ordinary Americans in 1788
1787, 88, were allowed to participate in
the ordainment process.
And that's why this constitution should
trump
an ordinary statute passed, perhaps more
recently enacted
in the ordinary ways by ordinary
legislatures.
Because there isn't that the ordinary
statute,
can't claim that kind of popular
sovereignty mandate
that this Constitution itself can claim by
the fact of its special ordained and
establishment.
Similarly, amendments to the Constitution,
precisely because
they have to go through a very special
process, they have to win the support of 2
3rds of the House, and 2
3rds of the Senate and three quarters of
the states.
They've these amendments, precisely
because they reflect a particularly broad
and deep democratic consensus, are
entitled to trump a statute.
Even a more recent statue just passed
by ordinary legislatures in the ordinary
way without
necessarily having achieved the special
super majorities of
2 3rds House, 2 3rds Senate, three
quarters
of the states.
So that's the theory of popular
sovereignty that I think legitimates the
idea
that the Constitution is supreme law
because
it's in some sense more deeply democratic.
Okay, so that's the theory.
And then along comes the 19th amendment.
That's the women's suffrage amendment.
And I think this complicates the story,
because once women's
suffrage is actually embraced as a
constitutional principle, it, it's, it's,
this amendment, is unintentionally
perhaps, but deeply unsettling.
Because I think the deep logic of the
Nineteenth Amendment is that women are
equal political participants, but of
course they
weren't at the founding, or during the
Reconstruction.
In fact they weren't even equal political
participants in the very process by which
the Nineteenth Amendment became law.
And so the, the nanosecond that the
Nineteenth
Amendment becomes part of the supreme law
of the
land, I think it, it complicates and
unsettles, to
some extent this popular sovereignty story
we've been telling.
And the precise extent to which it
unsettles isn't explicitly specified in
the Nineteenth Amendment.
To some extent, it's unwritten.
And what I'd like to do in today's
lecture, and the companion
one, is to explore the, the profound
implications of the Nineteenth Amendment.
Of the, the suffrage revolution and
what it might mean for American
Constitutionalism.
So let's begin with a hypothetical.
Let's imagine that Congress
tomorrow were to pass a sweeping law of,
aiming to vindicate women's rights.
A law kind of along the lines of a statute
called the Violence Against Women's Act
that Congress actually did pass a, a, a
while back, and part of which the Supreme
Court,
in fact, invalidated as going beyond
congress' power.
Let's imagine that this law says that
private violence
against women when a man attacks a woman
because she is a
woman, targets her, because of her, her
gender
is now a, a federal offense of some sort.
And lets imagine that the
law provides for special civil remedies
for women who have
been targeted for, by violent men, because
they are women.
Let's imagine this law further provides
all sorts of protections
of, of women against governmental
discrimination and private employer
discrimination.
And now, let's imagine that some people
raise questions
about whether Congress legitimately has
the power to pass a law like that.
Now I think if you just read the text of
the Constitution, you
can see that it's fairly capable of being
read to support this Congressional law.
Now, remember the Fourteenth amendment
begins by saying
everyone born in America is born a
citizen.
That is where, everyone is born equal, an
equal citizen.
And women are born equally
with men.
And the last sentence of that amendment
says Congress shall power to enforce this.
And the Nineteenth amendment is all about
sex discrimination.
And there's another clause that says
Congress shall
have power to enforce this by appropriate
legislation.
So you might think that Congress has very
sweeping power to protect women's
rights against all sorts of threats to
them threats against women as women.
but, but here's the counter argument.
Well, maybe the text is broad enough, but
actually, we think the legislative
history, a critic might say, of the
Fourteenth amendment shows it's all about
race.
Doesn't say race but really, we think when
you look
at the legislative history, it's about
race and not sex.
And the Nineteenth amendment, yes, it's
about
sex discrimination, but sex discrimination
in voting.
And what does private violence against
women have to do with voting?
What does employment discrimination
have to do with voting?
And so, so, so we don't think, based on
the legislative history, that the Congress
has the sweeping power.
now, I, myself, think that they've got the
history, to
some extent, wrong about the Fourteenth
Amendment, and the Nineteenth Amendment.
The history of the Fourteenth Amendment is
a history of equality.
And they could have used the word
race in the Fourteenth Amendment, they
didn't.
They used the word race in the Fifteenth
Amendment about
voting rights, but in the Fourteenth, it's
a broader principle.
It's a principle of birth equality, that
everyone is born equal, created equal.
And that's a principle, that we're born
equal, not just black
and white, the race issue, but we're born
equal, male and female.
And in fact, women were strongly
supportive feminists
of Section One of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and and others.
They didn't like section two of the
Fourteenth
Amendment, that inserted the word male
when it
came to voting rights, but section one
they
thought was affirm, about affirming equal
rights of all.
and, and the 19th amendment is about
women's equal
political participation and, and yes,
actually in order to
be politically equal I think e- eh,
Congress
made believe that a prerequisite of that
is
that women be equal in the workplace, and
be equal when they walk out on the street.
And and, and equal in their ability to be
protected against, against private
violence
against them, because they're women.
Congress might legitimately think so, but
suppose someone thinks the legislative
history is
too narrow, that that goes too far?
My claim is, why should we let that
legislative history of the Fourteenth
Amendment, of the Nineteenth Amendment, if
it were read, I think wrongly in
my view, but if it were read to offer a
kind of a
narrow conception of women's rights, why
should
we allow that legislative history to
travel?
Because after all, that legislative
history, is the
history of men, and because men are thee
only ones voting on the Fourteenth
Amendment.
And men overwhelmingly are the ones voting
on the Nineteenth Amendment.
Yes, in some states women have the vote
already,
so there participating in the conversation
and the votes about
whether to take that women's suffrage idea
and make it
the law of the land across America the
federal amendment.
But, but in lots of states, the people who
are voting on women's suffrage are men and
only men,
because these states don't have women
suffrage yet.
And, and so the radical thought is, the
very
nanosecond that the Nineteenth Amendment
is adopted, it kind of
calls into question the fairness of the
process up to
that point, even the process up to its own
adoption.
If women, after the Nineteenth Amendment
are adopted, are supposed to be
political equals, wasn't it unfair that
they weren't equal parts in the process
that the process that, that generated the
Nineteenth Amendment?
That they really weren't any part of the
official voting process
that generated the Fourteenth Amendment
and, and before that, the founding?
so, let me give you an analogy.
If, when my kid turns 18, he's going to
get
to vote, and he's going to say, you know,
dad
but, you know, they didn't let me vote
last
year and the year before, and the year
before that!
And I say, yes, that's because, you know,
last year you were 17, and the year before
that, you were 16.
You weren't actually mature enough.
Now you're 18, now you get to vote.
But there's nothing that happened before
was really unfair.
Is that what women's suffrage was like?
We say, oh well, women you know, in 1920,
they're intelligent enough
and capable enough to vote, but boy, in
1919, they were really
immature.
And in 1918, they just weren't ready for
this and,
and in 1867 you know, they were, they were
just children.
And the founding, they were just not able
to think straight.
No.
I think the Nineteenth Amendment, the deep
logic of it, it's not on
the surface of the of, of, of the of the
amendment it gets.
It's unwritten but I think unmistakable
that
the idea is that women are the political
equals of men and, and this is not
something new that's happening in 1920.
This, this has always been true.
And to some extent, the Nineteenth
Amendment as I said, calls
into question the fundamental fairness of
everything that has gone before.
And here's now, let's go back to our
hypothetical.
If Congress were to pass this law
affirming women's rights, the Congress
that's passing it, is a Congress in which
women are members of that Congress.
And women are voting for all of the
members of that Congress.
And, if that law is being trumped by
an earlier Constitution in which women
were not full
participants, in the Fourteenth Amendment
and the Nineteenth Amendment
the process by which the Nineteenth
Amendment was adopted.
And if that congressional statute that
we're
hypothesizing were invalidated because of
the legislative history
of the Fourteenth and the Nineteenth
Amendment, an overwhelmingly male
legislative history.
Is that really popular sovereignty when a
more, arguably sort of
democratic and more recent enactment in
which women are full participants
is being trumped by an earlier process in
which women were
excluded wrongfully, it seems to me, from
a certain point of view?
The point of view of the logic of the
Nineteenth Amendment itself.
That's, that's the, the thought.
So I'm proposing an unwritten rule of
interpretation that, I
think, does justice to the deep logic of
the Nineteenth Amendment.
Where the text is fairly, of the
Constitution, is fairly capable of being
read different ways, we should hesitate to
invalidate Congressional laws affirming
women's
equality, based on legislative history
that's overwhelmingly male.
of, of amendments in which women were not
full participants.
That's not really consistent with a
constitution of popular sovereignty.
The deep logic of why the Constitution is
supreme,
because it actually is more democratic
than an ordinary statute.
Is that so in a hypothetical or instead,
is that stature actually more democratic?
Because it is involving women fully in a
way
that the Nineteenth Amendment itself
didn't fully involve women.
The Fourteenth Amendment didn't fully
involve
women, the founding didn't fully involve
women.
now, you might think, gee, are you saying,
professor, that all
sorts of Constitutional provisions mean a
lot more than they say on their face?
And I'm saying, that's exactly what I'm
saying,
and it's not unique to the Nineteenth
Amendment.
Let's take the freedom of speech.
We've talked about it a lot in, in this,
course.
When the people commit themselves in the
First Amendment to the freedom of speech,
I think the deep logic of that is that we
the people are sovereign, in America.
We have a broad right of political
expression, a
right of political expression, much
broader than Parliament had.
Actually much broader than the English
cit-,
citizenry had, because in England,
Parliament is sovereign
and so it has freedom of speech and debate
from the French parlez, to speak.
But ordinary British subjects actually,
actually aren't sovereign and so
they may not have the same broad freedom
of speech.
Parliament is socially superior to them
and legally sovereign.
But in America, no Our government
officials are not superior to us socially.
They work for us.
We pay them.
They are our servants, they are our
agents, and we are sovereign.
And so the deep logic is, British style
laws limiting free speech are not
appropriate in America.
Now, did every, that's the logic of the
freedom of speech.
That's the logic, when, when, extended to
all
Americans, that's the logic of American
popular sovereignty.
Did everyone at the founding understand
that?
No, they didn't.
That's why, shortly after
the founding, you have people voting for
sedition acts.
John Adams, signing into law, basically
echoing British-style censorship.
And they said, well, you know, this is,
this is okay, Britain does it.
They didn't appreciate, no, in America,
we've
committed ourselves to a newer, broader
revolutionary principle.
James Madison understood the principle,
but did everyone else at the time?
Actually, not quite.
The First Amendment
meant more than everyone perhaps in-,
initially understood.
It had logical entailments and
implications.
And the very fact of popular sovereignty
maybe
went further than every, than some people
initially recognized.
Take the Reconstruction.
Originally the, the folks who give you
an end to slavery think they can just stop
there.
Okay, we ended slavery, we did it
immediately,
universally, without justi-, without
compensation for the slave masters.
That's a lot.
That's a good day's work, we're done.
But then they began to realize, no
actually that wouldn't be stable.
You can't give people freedom and not
guarantee their equal citizenship.
Not guarantee their, ultimately, their
equal voting
rights, at least in the South because,
how can these Southern governments, be
genuinely republican
governments, when they're disfranchising a
huge number of Freemen.
And upon reflection, Reconstruction
Republicans thought no we
actually have to go further than the
Thirteenth Amendment.
We've got to make sure that at least in
the South freed
slaves get to vote um,uh, because
otherwise the southern governments won't
be republican.
But they thought, okay that's
only in the South.
Maybe we don't have to do that for the
North.
So we're going to impose black suffrage on
the
South as a condition of the South's coming
back into the Union and getting, receiving
Congress,
but we won't impose that on the North.
And then, people began to think no
actually, the
deep logic of, of equality, of battle
sacrifices of,
of free blacks of, of the deepest and
broadest
ideas of republican government is, the
Northern states have
to let blacks vote equally, too, not just
the Southern states.
And this gets codified in the Fifteenth
Amendment.
And so, actually, although the Thirteenth
Amendment began more
modestly, people under- began to
understand shortly thereafter that it
had implications and entailments that,
that upon reflection, really
had to go further than merely an end of
slavery.
And so we end up with an affirmation of
citizenship
in the Fourteenth Amendment and the
imposition of
certain rules about black suffrage on the
former Confederacy
and eventually the extension of those
rules of,
of equal racial suffrage to the North, as
well.
So, what was true of the First Amendment,
what was true of
the reconstruction, seems to me, is also
true of the Nineteenth Amendment.
It, it has broader and
deeper implications than merely a right to
vote.
In the lex-, next lecture, I'll trace a
few more of the implications.
Today I talked about it's implications for
Congressional power
to pass laws protecting women in all sorts
of ways.
In the next lecture I'll tell you about
how we need to rethink marriage laws to
some
extent in light of the Nineteenth
Amendment, the
role of the First Lady and the
Vice-Presidents in
light of the Nineteenth Amendment.
And we'll talk about actually Griswold and
Roe, two very famous cases about women's
rights.
In the 20th century in again in light of
the, the, the women's suffrage idea, the
women's equality idea.
So lots still to talk about.
and, and I'm going to end as always by
telling
you a little bit about the the picture for
this chapter.
This is a picture about women on juries or
not on juries.
And it turns out the Nineteenth amendment
has something
to say about that, as well, so stay tuned.
