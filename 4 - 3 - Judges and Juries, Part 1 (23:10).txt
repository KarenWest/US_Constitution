Welcome back.
Today we're going to begin a discussion of
Article Three of the Constitution, the
Judiciary article.
The discussion that we're going to have in
this session and the next
one corresponds to chapter six of the
book, America's Constitution: A Biography.
The chapter is called Judges and Juries
and it opens with a picture
of the famous John Marshall, the great
John Marshall, perhaps the greatest chief
justice
in the, the history of the United States.
And at, in the next session, I'll tell you
a
little bit about this picture and how it
sums up
many of the themes of, of this segment,
this chapter
Judges and Juries and many of the themes
of Article Three.
But before we get to that you may be
wondering why there's only
one chapter on the judiciary.
Remember that after our
chapter on the Preamble, the first coupla
lectures of, of this part of the course,
we had actually two chapters on Article
One, the Legislature; so, four lectures on
that.
We had two chapters, again four lectures
on Article Two, the presidency.
But we've only got one chapter on, on the
judges.
And in fact, actually they have to share
that chapter with the juries.
As indeed in Article Three, they, they
share,
judges share pride of place with juries.
So, what's up with that?
Why less attention to the judiciary in
this walk through the written
constitution, and
the answer is, because there's less
attention
in the written Constitution itself to
judges.
It's Article Three out of three.
And in fact there's less text in
Article Three, it's the shortest article
of the three big ones.
The Legislature gets the most attention,
is first and longest.
Executive is second and second longest and
as I said the judiciary is
third out of three and the federal judges
who feature prominently in Article Three
actually have to share the stage with with
the juries who can be
seen as we're going to talk about it a
little bit more, as the lower
house in a sense, so a bicameral
judiciary.
So just as there is a, a bicameral
Legislature with
an upper house a Senate and a lower house
The House
of Representatives, are kind of a
bicameral judiciary, with the
upper house of of judges selected in a
more refined ways.
A small, group of rather elite of folk and
and the lower house a more populist house
corresponding
perhaps to the House of Representatives,
the lower house of the framers' judiciary
at least, of the Const-, the original
Constitution's judiciary involves juries.
So, one question really to begin with is:
why did the fr-, Constitution,
Why did the framer's treat the judiciary
least and, and last?
Why did they make them third out of three?
And I think
the answer begins with the American
Revolution.
You cant understand our Constitution
without understanding our history.
Our history as a people is to a very
considerable extend, the
history of our wars and the Constitution
is a reflection of our wars.
The, the original Constitution is a
reflection
of the American Revolution as we're
going to
see after the Civil War, the Constitution
is going to be transformed with three
important amendments:
the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments.
And in the 20th Century actually, wars
both World War I and World
War II and the Cold War will be reflected
in the written text.
So, so here's the key fact you need to
understand about Articles One and Two
and how they were affected by the American
Revolution, and then we'll come to Article
Three.
Article One big idea.
This is going to be Congress is going to
have the power
to tax and regulate, and precisely because
of that, this new
Congress, under Article One, is going to
have to be much
more representative than the old Congress
in the Articles of Confederation.
The old Congress couldn't tax individuals,
couldn't pass laws as such directly
regulating individuals, and so it didn't
need to be picked by individuals.
But since the new Congress
is going to be able to tax individuals, is
going to be
able to regulate individuals, it has to be
representative of individuals.
Why?
because that's what the American
Revolution
was all about: no taxation without
representation.
Parliament had the pretension to purport
to tax and
regulate Americans, even though Americans
didn't vote for parliament.
That was illegitimate.
That was one of the basic rallying cries
of the American Revolution.
These guys who we're not voting for,
shouldn't get to
directly regulate out internal affairs and
shouldn't get to tax us.
That's the American position as of 1776.
So that's what the revolution is all about
and
you see a reflection of that in Article
One.
Now, the Declaration of Independence is
also declaring independence from the king.
George the Third was viewed by Americans
as a tyrant
a despot.
And Article Two is a reflection of how we
don't want our president to be like
England's king.
We don't want our George, George
Washington,
to look like England's George, George the
Third.
And so we try to structure a presidency
that has some
of the virtues of the English monarchy,
stability, at its best.
English Monarchy at it's best.
Stability in foreign affairs, a strong
military leadership and, and commitment to
national security.
But, with all sorts of democratic
safeguards of election
and impeachment and checks and balances
and the like.
So Article One reflects the American
Revolution.
The Congress has to be Representative.
Article Two reflects the American
Revolution.
We want a president who's very strong like
a king, but
isn't going to be tyrannical like a king,
isn't going to be possibly
an idiot or stupid, like a King can
be, because in England, you're just born
to the
position and, and maybe you're just really
not
frankly equipped to govern, but there you
have it.
You're a king nonetheless.
And America's Constitution in Articles One
and Two, are a
reflection of the American revolution, so
too with Article Three.
Here's the payoff point.
It's said that, that judges
in the colonies generally were not
patriot leaders.
In ten they were picked by the
king in most of the colonies.
Whereas legislatures
had, local legislatures were picked by the
citizenry, and,
and governors in many of the states, at
least were
picked by the, the citizenry.
Not in all the states, but in some of them
were picked by the citizenry.
But judges generally, in, in most of the
states were picked by the Crown.
They were loyal to King George.
The payoff fact is that at the time of the
American Revolution, the chief judges
in 10 of the 13 colonies sided with George
the Third and not George Washington.
So judges are not the heroes of the
American Revolution.
Local militias are, local juries are
playing
an important role in resisting
Parliamentary taxation
by sort of acquitting tax smugglers and
tax cheats and custom smugglers and the
like.
So juries are the heroes of
American Revolution, local assemblies that
mobilize.
The colonialist are heroes of the American
Revolution,
local militias are, are seen as very
important
in this process, Lexington and Concord and
Bunker Hill.
George Washington is a hero of Revol-, of
the Revolution.
Judges, not so much.
Now, by the time of the Philadelphia
Convention, in 1787, 11 years after the
Declaration
of Independence, we've had, a regime in
which
and now actually the colonies have become
self-governing
states and the king isn't picking the
judges, in fact.
So Americans are picking their own judges.
And so you might think the, the time is
right for a more robust expression of
judicial power.
And there is more judicial power in
Article Three
than you see in many of the state
constitutions.
In all the state constitutions that
emerged
after the Revolution, the Judiciary's kind
of third
out of three.
It's the least powerful branch.
It's typically picked by the Legislature
or, and doesn't have the same kinds of in
many states, the same kinds of, of
independence that Article Three will give
federal judges.
In in only one state, Massachusetts, does
the constitution have
three separate sections of the
constitution
for the three branches of government.
And even then, typically and even then,
the judiciary is, is
third and with the least amount of text in
that constitution.
So, in the state constitutions, the
judiciary tends to be sort
of the weak a very weak branch, vis a vi,
the legislature.
And many of the state constitutions'
governors were quite weak.
These were state constitutions dominated
by the legislative branch.
Now by the time of the Philadelphia
Convention,
a lot of, of the Federalists, the supports
of the Constitution think that these state
constitutions
are actually bad because they have
inbalanced power structures.
The legislatures are too powerful, and
there's not enough of a check on them.
I think of the
39 people who were, at, Philadelphia, six
39 signers of the Constitution at,
at Philadelphia, six, actually, had been
prominent state or, or continental judges.
And and many of the, the great
lawyers of America were at the
Philadelphia Convention.
And some of them might have image
themselves that they might be judges
under the new system that was being
created.
And in fact, of the first six Supreme
Court Justices, half
of 'em are members of the Philadelphia
Convention, three of the six.
And actually of the five more that
Washington gets to appoint over the course
of, of his admin-, of his two terms, two
more are, are from Philadelphia.
So, so the, the, theframers of the
Constitution are creating a robust
judiciary in part because some of them
imagined that they will occupy this, this
position.
But still and we're going to see that
there are some special protections that,
that
are built into Article Three, but let's
just again, emphasize it's third out of
three.
Let's think about a few ways in which
it's still third out of three, not just
textually,
in, in order, and in the amount of text,
but, kind of structurally.
So first of all, there's a kind of
democratic logic or just conceptual logic
to the order.
First, actually the Legislature has to
pass laws, and then they have to
be implemented, that's Article One, they
have
to be implemented by an Executive branch.
And then, if people don't like that, cases
come
to court, the execute prosecutes some
people, some people sue.
The executive branch sue government, and
things come to court.
So, the Legislature first passes a law
Article One,
president executes it, Article Two, court
cases arise Article Three.
And that's just kind of a natural order.
In 1788 once the Constitution has been
ratified, the new government
that springs to life is going to
materialize in a certain order.
First the Congress has to meet, Article
One.
They have to meet first to count
the electoral votes.
And so only after the electoral votes are
counted does
the president kind of come on the scene,
Article Two, chronologically.
And only after both Congress and the
president are in place, actually can you
have, will they be able to pass laws
creating actually the judiciary structure.
Because Article Three as we're going to
see,
does not specify how many judges are
going to
be on the Supreme Court, how many lower
Federal Courts you can have.
It gives those decisions to Congress.
It specifies there will be one Supreme
Court, and such
inferior courts as Congress may from time
to time ordain established.
But Congress is going to basically shape
the
structure of the Judiciary to an important
extent.
So the Judiciary chronologically of the
founding, materializes third.
First the Congress comes on the scene,
then they count the electoral votes, and
then
Washington is summoned.
He appears, and then once he is there to
sign
or veto laws, you can have bills emerge
structuring the judiciary.
The most important early statute is called
the Judiciary Act of 1789.
It's passed in September of 1789, and it
basically sets up the early Judiciary
and puts it into operation.
And this reminds us of a kind
of a larger democratic pyramid that you
see in the Constitution.
The Preamble begins, it's the most
democratic
it's the base of this sort of
great pyramid with exceptional pol-
participation by ordinary
citizens, we the people, property
qualifications lowered
or eliminated in eight of the 13 states.
So the constitution begins with a very
broad, popular mandate in the preamble.
Article One, very, ru- ru- ru-, popular,
branch of government.
And Congress being, being created.
Article Two, a little bit more removed
from the people.
The Executive Branch with a more indirect
means of election through the electoral
college.
Article Three is that the, the, the apex
of
the pyramid it's but it's, it's the least
democratic.
It's furthest removed from the people.
And the basic structure of the
Constitution is more democratic branches
should select less democratic, not vice
versa.
So for example judges don't pick other
judges.
Presidents pick judges.
And judges don't pick their, their Chief
Justice, actually, politicians do.
In the House of Representatives, the
politicians pick their own Speaker.
The Senate picks their own
Pre-, Presiding Officer, President Pro
Tem, or Senate Majority leader.
So, in the Legislature, each branch picks
it's own leaders.
But the judges don't pick the Chief
Justice; they don't get to pick that.
In the Legislature
let's take the Executive branch.
Presidents get to pick cabinet officers,
their assistants,
but Justices don't get to pick lower
judges.
Each House gets to decide kind of how
it's going to operate with rules of its
own procedure.
But actually a Congress by law can specify
many of the procedures of the Judiciary.
What the rules of evidence are going to
be, what
the rules of civil and criminal procedure
are going to be.
Congress even has power to decide how many
justices there
are going to be, how many lower courts
there are going to be.
Presidents can fire cabinet officers at
will, as we talked about before.
Justices can't fire lower court judges at
will.
So the Judiciary has sort of less
regulatory power.
it, to some extent, is
under the control of the other more
politically accountable branches.
So there's, like, this grand dem-,
democratic pyramid.
Preamble first, it's the broadest base,
Article
One, second, is the next broadest populous
base, Article Two, a little bit less
broad, and, and the Judiciary on top.
And more politically accountable bodies
are picking
less politically accountable bodies, not
vice versa.
That's why many of us, that's a structure
reason why many
of us actually had some real questions
about Bush versus Gore.
The Supreme Court case because under the
Constitution, Presidents
are supposed to be picking judges, not
judges picking Presidents.
So you see the, the thirdness, the the how
the Judiciary Is
the least dangerous branch.
That's a phrase from Alexander Hamilton's
Federalist number 78, one of a
series of newspaper op-eds that the
Federalist write in support of the
Constitution.
You see how the judiciaries in some way is
the least dangerous branch.
Now, Federalist 78 says that judges are
going to have the
power to refuse to enforce laws that they
deem unconstitutional.
We call that judicial review, and
I think that is absolutely bedrock in our
system.
Federalist 78 defends that idea.
The Anti-Federalist understood this.
Some of them were critical of it, but they
understood
that judicial review was going to be part
of the system.
Several state courts had already begun to
hold unconstitutional
state statutes as violations of state
constitutions.
so, the idea of judicial review was kind
of in the air.
There was some uncertainty about exactly
when and how state
judges should do this, how often they had
done it.
But I think the framers of the
Constitution did expect that federal
judges would decline to enforce laws that
the federal
judges thought were unconstitutional even
if the House, and the Senate, and
the President thought that these were
perfectly valid laws.
Now, remember that's not a unique power of
the judiciary.
People in the House of Representatives can
vote against the law and should if
they think it's unconstitutional, even if
they
know the Supreme Court would uphold it.
And so too with the Senate.
So even today, after the Supreme Court has
upheld the Obamacare legislation,
it's perfectly permissible for members of
the House and Senate to say,
we still think it's unconstitutional, and
we're going to try to repeal it.
We're not going to fund it.
That's a constitutionally permissible
thing for them to do.
Now I happen to think, and we can get into
this
later perhaps so that the statute, the
Obamacare statute is not unconstitutional.
But our system of government creates
multiple
checks and balances against an arguably
unconstitutional law.
The house can vote against it, and if the
house votes against, it doesn't
become a law, even if the court would
uphold it.
And so too with a Senate, and a president
can veto it and and he can pardon
people who are convicted under statutes
that he thinks is unconstitutional.
Even after judges have upheld convictions,
presidents can pardon people.
Thomas Jefferson pardons people convicted
under the Sedition
Act even after, the Sedition Act of, of
1798
part of the Alien Sedition Acts because
Thomas Jefferson thinks
that's an unconstitutional statute, even
though courts have upheld that statute.
So just as the House can basically,
sometimes be the last word and just
say no and make the no stick if the no is
we think it's unconstitutional.
And the Senate and the President, so too
would the Judiciary.
The Judiciary has this power to refuse to
enforce
any law that it deems unconstitutional.
To bolster that power, the Judiciary is
given life tenure
independence from the, the Legislature.
Once selected, it's a political selection
process.
Presidents pick judges, and they can pick
them by paying attention to the judge's
philosophy, and from the beginning,
presidents have
tended to likely judicial philosophy of
appointees.
Washington, early on, picked only
Federalists for the court.
And for much of Amer-,
most of American history, presidents have
tended to pick on judges that they think
support their general vision.
And the Senate too can, can
confirm judges that they believe have a
proper judicial philosophy.
So it's a political selection process with
the Presidency and the Senate But once the
judges are selected, they have, life
tenure,
tenure for good behavior in the language
of the Constitution.
They can't just be
sacked as a cabinet officer can if
the president decides he doesn't like
their opinions.
Their salary is undiminishable, it can't
go down.
It can go up and and that's because they
sit for life
there may be inflation, and there may be a
need for salary adjustments.
But they have once selected, some
independence.
And Federalist 78 tells us that one of the
most important reasons that they
have judicial independence is there is
going to be this power of judicial review.
They are on occasion going to need to
invalidate laws or refuse to enforce
laws that they in their own mind, think
is, uncon-, think are unconstitutional.
And Hamilton in 78 says, when law, when
they believe the laws are contrary
to the manifest tenor of the Constitution
and are kind
of clearly unconstitutional, the judges
should simply just, just say, no.
Now,
there is judicial review, but the question
is how robust
a vision of judicial review did the
framers really imagine?
Did they imagine judges striking down all
sorts
of laws all the time or just occasionally?
Did they imagine judges would strike down
laws that were only arguably
unconstitutional or instead strike down
laws
that were clearly and undeniably
unconstitutional?
Did they imagine the judges would strike
down mainly laws
regulating the judiciary itself or all
sorts of other statutes?
So, there is judicial review in the
Constitution, but what kind of judicial
review?
How do juries fit into the whole equation?
These are some of the questions we're
going to talk about in our next lecture.
And we'll come back to this picture of
John Marshall.
So stay tuned.
