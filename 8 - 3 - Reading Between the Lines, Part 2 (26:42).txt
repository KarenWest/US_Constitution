Welcome back.
We're talking about one particular
technique of non-literalistic
Constitutional interpretation, a
technique of holistic interpretation, of
reading
the document as one whole document.
Of reading between the lines to make sense
of the document's largest purposes.
To establish justice, and justice
is not established when someone can
preside, be a judge in his own case,
unless the constitution really, very
specifically authorizes
that, in ways that the Framers clearly
intended.
The Constitution talks about protecting
the common defense, establishing common
defense.
And John Marshall, in the case called
McCollough, says that because a
bank is actually, a national bank is very
useful to, conducive to, national defense,
it clearly falls with in congresses the
federal government's broad
powers even though their isn't a specific
bank clause, because it makes
sense, that congressional power, makes
sense of the document as a whole.
Those were a couple of examples we're
going to talk about some more in this
lecture.
Let me just step back for a moment though
and tell you why this Vice President
not presiding in his own impeachment
trials seems,
to me, so interesting theoretically, and
actually important practically.
And you might say, that's weird.
Who, who cares?
Does it matter?
Imagine a scenario.
This is a very low probability event, but
imagine,
but this, this is how republics actually
can end.
Imagine a scenario in which a Vice
President is being impeached.
He's corrupt and he tries to preside at
his own impeachment trial and skew the
proceedings.
In the meantime, while all this is
happening, the country's
aghast, but who cares, it's just the Vice
President, they say.
And then, the President dies.
And now this person who should have been
convicted, becomes President of
the United States and he has no legitimacy
in America, in the world.
How are people going to respect this
corrupt person who, standing
on the literal words of the Constitution,
has tried to pervert justice?
This, this is how coup d'etat happen, and,
and, and,
and people rioting in the streets and, and
how regimes lose
their legitimacy.
So it actually has practical significance
even though it's a low probability event.
It has even greater theoretical
significance, because you might say,
okay, I buy the idea that there are
unwritten precepts
like separation of powers, which isn't in
so many words,
checks and balances, the rule of law,
limited government, federalism.
Okay, I buy all of that, but where the
constitution
is specific, we always follow the specific
clause.
But here, the specific, I the specific
clauses, when you read them, seem to
say the Vice President presides at his
own impeachment trial, and that can't be
right.
Here the constitution, read holistically,
not just means
more than the words one by one, sentence
by
sentence, but the exact opposite of what
the
words seem to say when read by the
standard
rules of the English language.
So, so the claim is sometimes when you
read the
constitution holistically, not only do you
go beyond the meaning of
the sentences, they might, at least in
this case, lead to
the almost exact opposite result of what
literalism would get you.
This is kind of the, the constitutional
law equivalent of sawing a lady in
half, which is a pretty neat trick if you
can pull it off.
but, my belief is most
lawyers, left, right, and center would
actually agree with me
that a Vice President can't preside to his
own impeachment trial.
And most lawyers think that McCulloch v.
Maryland is one of the preeminent
constitutional cases of all time.
And when you read it, it is not a narrow
literalistic text based opinion.
It's not based on the necessary and proper
clause.
But on the document, as a whole, and the
idea that it can't specify everything.
Because if it did, here's Marshall's
phrase.
It would partake of the prolixity of a
legal code.
It was just be, it'd be like the tax code.
It'd be just too long and complicated and
tedious.
And an ordinary farmer couldn't have read
it.
And the great strength of America's
Constitution is that
ordinary farmers could read it and did
read it.
The came from the people and it can't have
that, that populist quality to it if it's
really long.
It has to be a short document.
And if it's short,
words, word by word won't capture the
whole thing.
We have to read between the lines.
We have to read it as a whole.
That was also Marshall's thought on the
second question that he confronted in
McCulloch.
The first question was, can Congress
create a federal bank?
And he said, yes, even though there's no
bank
clause, there are actually implicit powers
and this one
is one of them because a bank is useful
for national security, which is in the
documents as a
whole, read holistically.
That was question one.
Can Congress create a national bank?
Question two is, once Congress is conceded
to have power to have lawfully, properly
created the national bank, can states
impose tax on that national bank?
And Marshall said no, you can't.
But here's what he admitted, the statute
creating
the bank did not explicitly say that no
state
could impose a tax on it.
So, for Marshall what's doing the work in
the second part of his opinion, which
he strikes down a state law, a Maryland
law, imposing a tax on this national bank.
What's doing the work is not the words of
the statute in it of themselves.
It's a larger, structural principle.
Once again, Marshall returns to structure,
and the
basic structure ID is the part can't
interfere
with the whole.
When Maryland imposes a tax on the federal
bank,
it's basically imposing a tax on the, on
all
the rest of us outside of Maryland who
helped
create this bank, and, and we're not
represented in Maryland.
When Maryland imposed the tax on the
federal bank,
the part is controlling the whole which
isn't right.
Maryland is in fact imposing a tax on New
Yorkers and and
Rhode Island people and people from
Connecticut and people from Massachusetts.
We all in Congress helped create this
bank, we're all funding it, and so, and
Maryland is taxing it, it's in effect
picking our pockets, and that's taxation
without representation.
because we, as New Yorkers and Connecticut
people and Rhode
Island people and Massachusetts people,
are not represented in Maryland.
So, a kind of Declaration of
Independence principle.
It's not in so many words in the
Constitution, but Marshall says the basic
structure of the Constitution is people
can
tax only their own constituents, in
effect.
And the check on oppressive taxation is,
if you tax your constituents too much
and they think that this is too
burdensome, they'll throw the bums out of
office.
and, but that doesn't work if Maryland is
imposing a
tax, the Maryland legislature, not on
Marylanders, who can vote
the bums out of office, but is imposing a
tax on New Yorkers, and Connecticut
people, and Massachusetts people.
When the part is imposing a tax on the
whole.
Again, structural analysis, trying to make
sense of the constitution as a whole.
If Marshall is right this gives one
reason for explaining why federal courts
have properly
limited states, when they sometimes try to
do nasty things to other states and, and,
and limit the ability of, of, of other
states to sell goods in their market.
So, this is a doctrine called the dormant
commerce clause, and some narrow
textualists justices, Scalia and
Thomas, have raised questions about it,
but actually the,
the doctrine kind of flows from McCulloch
in a way.
The deep structural principle
that states shouldn't be imposing costs on
out of staters who aren't represented.
Congress, can allow individual states, to
do this.
Congress could have allowed, Maryland to
impose a tax on the Federal Bank.
But that's because, in Congress, all are
represented.
Congress didn't have to create a bank in
the first place.
It could have, created a bank and taxed
it.
It could have created a bank and taxed
it and give that, given that money to
Maryland.
So it could allow Maryland maybe to do the
same thing.
But that's because all are represented.
The whole is represented in Congress, but
not in an individual state.
And the doctrine of the dormant commerce
clause, another kind of, unwritten
constitutional principle is, states can't
basically
interfere with a free flow of goods
and services in a national market place,
but Congress is allowed to do all sorts
of regulations and prohibitions because,
in Congress, all are represented.
Okay, so that leads to another
hypothetical.
We're just taking a, a, a principle.
Reading the constitution as a whole, and
finding some applications.
That's what we're going to do again and
again in this part of the course.
So here's a hypothetical.
If states can't impose restrictions on a
national bank.
Suppose instead they try to impose
restrictions.
They can't shutdown a national bank.
What if they try to impose restrictions
on?
What if they try to,
shutdown a national discourse?
So let's imagine it's 1850.
And there's this anti-slavery Illinois
congressman let's call him, Lincoln
Abraham, he's hypothetical, and he gives a
speech against slavery and Congress.
He says slavery it's a bad thing, we
should eventually get rid
of it the federal government should
subsidize the abolition of slavery by
individual
state because this will be the death of
us, it's a very bad thing.
He gives that speech in the House of
Congress and then he goes
and he says that, and he, and he prints it
up as a pamphlet.
And he distributes that pamphlet to his
friends in Illinois and he also, through
private channels, gives it to friends to
distribute in North Carolina and, and
other states
And then North Carolina tries to prosecute
Lincoln Abraham for stirring
up the slaves, which is a crime in North
Carolina.
In fact, it's a capital offense in North
Carolina to criticize slavery.
And they tried to shut down preachers in
the pulpit
who say slavery is a sin, it's a bad
thing.
So, North Carolina
tries to do this in a hypothetical.
Now can they do it?
And you might say, well of course they
can't.
We have the First Amendement.
But
the words of the First Amendment actually,
what's the first
word of the First Amendment for being, if
we're just literalists?
The first word of the First Amendment is
Congress.
Congress shall make no law abridging free
speech and the freedom of the press.
But, in our hypothetical, it's the state
that's doing it.
So can a state shut down this discourse on
slavery, the biggest political, legal,
constitutional issue in the nation in the
1850s?
Can a state shut down that national
discourse any more than it's allowed
to allowed to shut down a national bank,
which it's not allowed to do.
So if it's not allowed to do that should
it be allowed to shut down a national
debate?
But if its isn't where does the
Constitution say so?
[COUGH] Well, you might say, actually
there
is a free speech clause in, now today
we have a thing called the 14th Amendment
that says, no State shall make or
enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United
States.
No State can violate fundamental freedoms,
and one of those freedoms
is free speech, and we're going to talk a
lot about that
clause and how that's definitely a clause
about protecting free speech against
states like North Carolina, when they try
to shut down free speech.
But there's one problem for a hypothetical
Lincoln Abraham.
Have you figured it out?
The problem is the 14th Amendment hasn't
yet been adopted.
We're talking about 1850.
The 14th Amendment is after the Civil War.
And because states like North Carolina did
try to shut down free speech, we needed a
14th Amendment that said we're going to
protect free
speech, not just against congress, but
against states.
But that's often the future, and the words
of the First Amendment only talk about
congress
so what could Lincoln Abraham do?
Well maybe you could point to a
clause that the constitution, the original
constitution before
the 14th Amendment that says there should
be freedom of speech and debate in
Congress.
And indeed, in Congress, you can get up
and say anything you want
and that freedom of speech and debate
can't be challenged outside of Congress.
You can't be prosecuted by a state court
in a state court or sued
for libel in the state court or, or
prosecuted by the President.
So, there is absolute freedom of speech
and
debate in the original constitution, in a
congressional assembly.
Only problem is Lincoln Abraham wasn't,
didn't
just speak in Congress he distributed the
pamphlet.
And maybe he could say if the only
thing he distributed is this pamphlet
that's word for
word his congressional speech, well maybe
he'd be
protected by the Article I speech and
debate clause.
But suppose he went beyond what he said on
the floor of Congress?
Or just to modify
the hypothetical, suppose that Lincoln
Abraham isn't a,
a sitting congressperson but a candidate
for Congress.
Suppose he's just a speaker and he thinks
that slavery is wrong and the
federal government should, should work to
get rid of it and so should states.
And again he's being prosecuted in North
Carolina, and
now he doesn't have speech or debate
clause immunity.
Either because he's a Congressman who went
beyond what
he said on the floor of the house or
because he's not a Congressman at all.
Now we come to the deepest thing.
The deepest idea is, forget the First
Amendment
it only says Congress, forget freedom of
speech
and debate, it's only about Congressman,
forget the
14th Amendment which isn't on the books
yet.
We the people of the United States are
sovereign,
governments work for us, we don't work for
them.
They are our servants, they can't tell us
politically
what to do, what to say, what to think.
We get to govern ourselves.
In, in England Parliament is sovereign and
they have freedom of speech and debate.
And in fact, the word parliament, from the
French parler, to speak.
As, that's a special speech spot.
And Congress is a special speech spot.
And state legislatures are special speech
spots.
But, in America, the whole country is
actually a speech spot that
deserves a lot of protection, because in
America we get to vote, and
we can't vote unless we can, about talk
about public issues amongst ourselves.
And it's as, it's an idea of making sense
of the constitution as a whole.
We have free and fair elections, and in,
those elections won't
be free and fair if incumbents are allowed
to shut down challengers.
If our government servants are allowed to
tell us what to do and think and say.
It would be as if my butler
my valet at my dinner table tried to tell
me I couldn't talk to my guests about
something.
No, he works for me, not the other way
around.
That's a structural principle.
It's reading between the lines.
It's reading the Constitution as a whole
and, and I think
it gives our hypothetical Lincoln Abraham
very broad freedom of speech.
Not maybe abso-, the same kind of absolute
freedom
of speech he has on the floor of the
House.
because on the floor of the House, he can
actually
spew lies and you can even and
maliciously,
intentionally, and he can't be sued for
liable.
He's utterly immune when he's on the floor
of the House.
There's a special absolute kind of free
speech
that he has on the floor of the House.
But outside that floor is not that he has
no free speech, but he
has just the free speech of all Americans,
which is a very broad one.
Yes that free speech is limited by rules
that you can't intentionally
spew lies
with, with, with with malice, but you have
an absolute right
to express your political opinion and no
one can shut that down.
That's a basic American free speech
principle that flows from understanding
the
system of the document as a whole, a
system based on popular sovereignty
and the idea that elections are supposed
to be free and fair and
our government servants work for us, not
the other way around, so we
get to criticize them and what they do and
government policy.
That's a structural argument, and it's an
argument broader than the First Amendment.
It's giving us rights not just against the
President, as
the First Amendment does, but against
federal courts, against not
just against, excuse me, Congress as the
First Amendment protects
against Congress, against Presidents,
against
federal courts, against states, against
counties.
It's a broader principle than the language
of the First Amendment
so, okay.
One other hypothetical, and then we'll
conclude by talking about this picture.
What about, let's talk about the real
Abraham Lincoln, not
Lincoln Abraham, but the real flesh and
blood Abraham Lincoln.
Suppose in mid March of 1861, South
Carolina
trumps up charges, North Carolina trumps
up charges against him, and
instead of succeeding they saw we are
going to indite Abraham Lincoln.
Because we say that he was in cahoots with
John Brown and
killed a lot of people because he was
plotting the Harper's Ferry Massacre.
And it's all trumped-up.
But they say, we demand that Abraham
Lincoln come
down and, and face justice here in North
Carolina.
Can a state prosecute a sitting President?
And see the Constitution doesn't say
in so many words that they can't.
There's no explicit clause that they, says
that they can't,
but if they could do that, you'd have the
part controlling
the whole in violation of the McCulloch
principle, that if the
federal government creates a bank, one
individual state can't undo it.
They could basically undo a national
election.
And you might say, well actually the
Constitution does say that they
can't do that because, the Constitution
says,
Presidents can be impeached and only
impeachment.
That's the only court to judge a sitting
President.
But textually document doesn't say that.
And Vice Presidents can be impeached and
let me say, it's very
clear that Vice Presidents can be,
sort of, prosecuted in ordinary criminal
courts.
Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton at
Weehawken
and states actually initiated prosecutions
against him.
Spiro Agnew Nixon's first Vice President,
actually was a crook and he was prosecuted
while a a Vice President and stepped down,
but he wasn't immune from prosecution.
Federal judges can be impeached, federal
cabinet officers can be impeached.
But that fact alone doesn't mean that
they're immune
from ordinary crimin-, state criminal
prosecutions when they're in office.
So, the impeachment clauses don't say that
this is the only mechanism and you can't
have more new
prosecution, and that's not the rule for
every other impeachable officer.
Vice Presidents, judges, cabinet officers,
they can all be criminally prosecuted.
So it's not a textual argument, quite.
I can read it into the words the, the
executive
power of the United States shall be vested
in the President.
But the words don't clearly compel that,
really.
What's doing the work is a structural
principle.
And the structural principle is the state
should,
a part shouldn't be able to undo the
whole.
That we have national elections.
And the president actually has to
accountable to all of us.
And when he is, he might be doing things
that are deeply unpopular.
[COUGH] Doing the people's business as a
whole.
internationally, domestically, he might do
stuff that makes him
deeply unpopular in some state or county
or town.
And precisely because of the Constitution
structures a grand inquest
in which he's accountable to the nation
when he misbehaves.
It's, in the, in the senate of the United
States, all are represented.
All the states, and so, so because he's a
national
figure, he has to be judged by a a
national tribunal.
And the text doesn't say that
specifically, just it's implicit in the
whole.
Now, once he's out of office, ordinary
states can have at him, that's
fine.
But they don't, they shouldn't be allowed
to undo an election.
Now, you could say, oh well professor, I
buy all that
but it's just the words, executive power,
that are doing the work.
But states have governors in whom
executive power is vested
under state constitutions, and most
sitting governors actually can be
prosecuted.
And here's why.
Sitting governors don't handle wars and
foreign affairs the
way presidents do, and there's a much
bigger, it's a
much bigger problem if a state's able to
distract a president when he's
in the middle of a foreign crisis or a war
or something like that.
When a state prosecutes its own Governor,
you don't have the part undoing the
whole, the way you do structurally when
the state tries to prosecute a sitting
President.
And when the federal government tries to
prosecute a sitting Governor, Rod
Blagojevich or
something like that, again, it's not the,
the part undoing the whole, it's the
whole monitoring the part.
so, so Governors and Presidents are both
vested with executive
power, but Governors aren't immune sitting
Governors from criminal prosecution.
Presidents are, because within the federal
system, they are the head
of the federal justice system and, and
everyone else is inferior
to them and can't prosecute them unless
they give them the
go ahead, and states shouldn't be allowed
to undo national elections.
The parts
should be able to undo the whole.
A structural argument and that structural
argument,
by the way, has been endorsed by scholars
on the, the left, Charles Black for
example, on the right, Robert Bork, Ken
Starr.
It's pretty broadly accepted, but the
Constitution
doesn't say so in so many words.
You have to read between the lines.
You have to make sense of the document as
a whole.
No well no man can be a, properly a party
in his own case.
No part may properly judge the whole.
These
these principles that, that no man can
properly judge his
own case and no part can properly judge
the whole.
These help the document, as a whole, make
sense.
They, they are ways of reading between the
lines and this is one of many techniques,
not the only one by which we go
beyond the written Constitution that,
ultimately, in order
to vindicate the written Constitution.
Before I conclude, just a word or two
about this picture.
This is the first presidential impeachment
trial.
It's the impeachment trial of Andrew
Johnson.
And he's being judged by Politico's who,
many of whom might want to be president.
That's what the definition of a Senator,
is
someone who wants to be President it
seems.
And the guy who's presiding over the
trial, the Chief Justice
himself actually wants to be president he
had, some Salmon P.
Chase, he ran for president in 1860 and
come in third in the Republican Primary.
He had tried to knock Lincoln off the
ticket,
he was a cabin officer for Lincoln,
Treasury Secretary.
He had tried to knock Lincoln off the
ticket in 64 and
make himself president in 19, in 1868 he
wants to president yet again.
He wants Andrew Johnson's
job, and he's not alone.
Chief Justice's in American have often
been presidential contenders.
John Jay, and John Rutledge actually were
early Chief Justice's.
Had come in third and fourth respectively,
in the presidential election of 1789,
right after Washington and Adams.
William Howard Taft
is going to be Chief Justice.
He's a former President of the United
States.
Charles Evan Hughes is another Chief
Justice.
He had actually run for the President.
He stepped down from the court to run for
the Presidency.
Earl Warren, a Chief Justice, had actually
run
for Vice President and Dewey had defeated
Truman.
Remember that famous Chicago Tribune
ad mistakenly predicting Dewey defeats
Truman?
But if Dewey defeated Truman in 1948, Earl
Warren would have been the Vice President.
So, Chief Justices are often people in
a pretty large, people with presidential
ambitions.
Chase was one of them.
But merely having presidential ambitions
doesn't
mean that he had to recuse himself.
because,
built into the very structure of the
Constitution, very plainly, is
politicos, people often with presidential
ambitions,
are going to be judging other politicos.
That's okay, but that's different than the
Vice
President presiding over the impeachment
trial of the President.
because the Vice President would
automatically become President upon a
guilty verdict, that's too much of a
conflict of interest.
A Vice President presiding over his own
impeachment trial, that's too much
of a conflict of interest.
Here, if the President's going to be
convicted, that doesn't mean that Chase
becomes President, it means that, you
know, he's going to be able to
run for it like everyone else and he'll
get it only if the
American people, vote for him and that's
not too big a conflict of interest.
You know, some people say that's a
really fine line you're drawing professor,
I agree.
And constitutional law often involves
fine lines.
But here is a fundamental point and here
we conclude.
Allowing Senators to judge Presidents,
even though
senators are, are politically ambitious,
presidentially ambitious
politicos, allowing them to, to try a
present, allowing the Chief Justice to
preside.
The Constitution clearly builds those
sorts of things into the document.
That's ambition checking ambition.
The Constitution.
That's the main object of the law, and we
go with it because the people,
that's what the people bought into.
The Vice President presiding at his own
impeachment trial.
No one thought of that.
No one thought that that was going to
happen.
That just is a weird, absurd, peripheral
application
with a, with a bigger conflict of
interest.
And that wasn't a central feature, the
main object of the Constitution as
understood
by, we the people of the United States
when we ordained and established it.
Okay, so that's one technique, its a
technique of holistic
reading, is not the only technique, we got
11 chapters to go,
so more techniques to, to to discuss so
stay tuned.
