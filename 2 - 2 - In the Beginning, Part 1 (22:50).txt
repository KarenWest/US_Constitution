Welcome back.
For our first substantive hour in this
online course on, the, on
constitutional law, we're going to focus
on the first sentence of the constitution.
Conventionally known as the preamble.
I'm going to have a couple of 20 minute
lectures, and then for our
third session in this hour, we'll do
something a little more conversational and
interactive.
So let's start
with the words.
This is how the written text, the terse
text begins.
We, the people of the United States, in
order to form
a more perfect union, establish justice,
ensure domestic tranquility, provide for
the common defense, promote the general
welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do
ordain and establish this
Constitution for the United States of
America.
One sentence.
And this, my friends, this one simple
sentence, changes everything.
It's the pivot of world history, the hinge
of history.
Before this sentence, you have
self-government,
democracy, existing almost nowhere on
planet earth.
In 1786, let's say the year before these
words were, were, first,
printed up You have, who, who governs
themselves, across the planet?
Well, to an extent, the British.
They have the House of Commons, after all.
But they also have an hereditary monarch,
and an aristocratic House of Lords.
But there's some self-governance in
Britain.
You have a few sheep herders and goat
herders in Switzerland who largely manage
to govern themselves.
And that's partly, partly because all the
neighbors
basically, you know, leave them alone
because it's
hard to charge up the hill and, once you
get to the top, there's nothing there.
There's just, as I said, a few sheep and
goats.
so, but the Swiss are self-governing to
some extent and the British And,
that's about it across the globe outside
of the United States.
The rest of the world is ruled by,
basically by thugs, by tyrants, kings,
emperors, czars, sultans, mo-gal lords,
tribal chieftains.
And so it had always been for millenni of
recorded, millennia of recorded history.
Self-government really had not been the
dominant mode of of, of a society.
You had, in ancient Greece, a few tiny
city-states
that, like Athens, that for a moment, for
a
brief period of time, had managed to
govern themselves, champion
the idea of democracy pre-imperial Rome,
but these City-states
typically had, had not been able to defend
themselves militarily.
They had, they had, they had, the, the
democracies, these republics had blanked
out after time.
And even when they existed, they existed
only over a,
a pretty small geographic area.
People often meeting face-to-face.
Lived in a city, in a polis.
Together, they worshiped the same god or
gods, they spoke
the same language, they had a common
climate and culture.
So, very little democracy, in 1786.
And in the history
of the world up to 1786.
Now, think about today's world.
The world of 2013, 2014.
Democracy, self-government, this idea
reigns over
roughly half the planet, by populataion
and, and geography.
You have, India, a billion people.
Largely self governing, they've got a
constitution and
they've got elections and free speech and
religious pluralism.
You've got
Eastern Europe you've got Western Europe.
Now, where
did this idea come from that people across
an entire subcontinent?
There's lots of languages and Indian
religions ethnicities.
And that an entire continent or
subcontinent could actually be governed
democratically.
It wasn't true of India in 1786.
It's, it's controlled
by the, by the British.
Crown by, by an unelected king.
And today, it's governing itself billion
people.
And, as I said, look at Western Europe.
France is governing itself.
That wasn't true in 1786.
They had pretty much you know, an
absolutus monarch on the throne.
Look at Germany.
Look at Italy.
They were not Poland, self governing
in 1786, and they are self governing
today.
What happened?
My claim is what happened, is the United
States Constitution happened.
A constitution that was born and an, an
extraordinary democratic process.
Up and down a continent in 1787 and 1788,
we.
The people of the United States did ordain
and establish a constitution, they
did it democratically and continentally,
as I said people up and down a vast
continent getting to vote on the basic
ground rules of their society.
They got to decide whether they were going
to adopt this constitution or not.
Ordinary farmers got a chance to read this
short document, short so that an
ordinary farmer could read it.
In 1787 88.
Think about it, talk with his.
his neighbors and decide whether he was
for it or against it.
That's the dramatic story of the Preamble
of the United States.
We the People.
Of the United States ordaining and
establishing a Constitution for our
posterity.
Never before in world history had so many
people gotten to
vote and talk about how they and their
posterity would be governed.
And the world would never be the same.
It's the hinge of human history, at least
secular history.
If you happen to be a Christian, you think
that the
world is divided between B.C. and A.D.,
that, that's the hinge.
From a secular
point of view, you can also talk about
B.C.
and A.D., before the constitution and
after the document.
This.
Document.
The United States Constitution gives us
our
modern world, a democratic world, a,
pluralistic world.
The world in which the idea of self
government is, is now on the ascendancy.
We won, we, the American idea of self
government
won the last century, the twentieth
century.
And I like our odds in the twenty first
century.
But that wasn't for or ordained.
In 1786, as I said, there's not very much
democracy on the planet.
And there hadn't been for, in recorded
history.
Today there's a lot and it's because
of the United States Constitution I
believe, and
it's because in particular of the story
told in the first sentence of the
Constitution.
That's why we're going to actually spend a
whole hour on a single sentence.
The preamble.
That first sentences, that announces this
epic constitutional project.
We the people.
That's the story for todays session.
so, I've encouraged
You to think about images.
The pictures, the images
that are associated with each of these
lectures.
Each of these pictures is taken from the
book America's Constitution a Biography.
Each chapter that begins with a picture.
You have the picture on your screen of,
of, of,
of the we have the image associated with
the, the preamble.
Let's, let's look at this together and
think what the themes here are.
What how this picture
tells a story.
Worth a thousand words.
This picture is taken from the
newspaper, The Pennsylvania Packet and
Daily Advertiser.
It's taken from September 19th, 1787.
That is two days after the Philadelphia
Convention has ended.
I begin my story, I want us to begin our,
journey through through the Constitution
after the Philadelphia Convention has
ended, in a way.
Why then?
Why do we start our story then on
September
19th rather than that long, hot summer in
Phildelphia
you've heard so much about from May
through September
with these delegates lead by Geprge
Washington who presided.
Ben Franklin was there, James Madison was
there, Alexander Hamelton was there for,
for some
of it.
For some of the most important parts of
it.
You've heard about that long, hot summer
in Philadelphia,
and that's not quite where we are starting
our story.
We're starting our story on September
19th.
Why?
Because that's when the Constitution went
public.
When this proposal that was hashed out
behind closed
doors in Philadelphia by a small group of
people,
mainly lawyers.
but, but, but what happened in
Philadelphia over that summer was just a
plan, a proposal that was, that was put
together, but it wasn’t yet public.
It wasn’t yet the law.
What made it the law was we, the people of
the United States,
over the next year agreeing to ordain and
establish it, to vote for it,
to make it binding law.
And that process, that year, a year that
changes everything in world history begins
on September 19,
1787 when for the first time, the document
goes public.
It's published by a publisher A newspaper
publisher.
Many across the continent.
And the word publish,
to make public, is the same root word as
people.
The same root word as republican
government.
It's an idea of people power.
Making something public.
Making it available to the people.
And the publishers don't have to, they,
they get to decide what they publish.
They are, we have a free press.
And they think this is big news, and they
publish the whole plan, the proposal.
And what do they do?
They highlight.
The Pennsylvania Packet is actually
published in Philadelphia.
And they print this proposal because it's
short enough to be printed in a newspaper.
Short enough for ordinary people to be
able to read it from
start to finish.
And the publishers understand that that
preamble is important.
See how they put it in bigger type?
They see the headline.
Publishers are good, they understand what
the headline is.
And the headline is we, the people we're
going to get to decide
whether we ordain and establish this
Constitution for the United States or not.
This is way more democratic than
anything that's previously happened in
world history.
That's the main, the main theme of today's
Talk of this, of this lecture.
We the people indeed.
Yes, in deed they are, are actually doing
something.
We the people of the United States, dot,
dot, dot, do ordain and establish this
constitution.
Well, what did they actually do?
Here's what they did.
They talked and they voted over the next
year.
Beginning in September, mid September,
1787.
13 individual states had special
elections, state by state.
Creating these special
conventions of the people, these special
assemblies of the people.
And each assembly
had one task only.
These conventions.
To discuss the Constitution, and at the
end, decide
whether they were going to vote for it or
not.
And it wasn't going to go into effect
unless nine of the 13 states said yes.
We do.
now, who and that's, that's the dramatic
story of the Preamble.
The people actually ordained the
Constitution.
That's news.
Why is that news?
Because that hadn't happened before in
world history.
Even the few democracies, republics,
self-governing societies that had
existed Before 17, before the American
Revolution let, let's say.
Even though Ancient Athens had a
democratic constitution
and indeed a written one, the Clystanic
Constitution.
It had not,
that constitution, hadn't been adopted, in
this dramatically democratic way.
Hadn't been put to a, a broad popular
vote.
Until the American Revolution whatever
self-governing societies
existed, they didn't have written
constitutions at all.
They just had traditions and customs that
sort of evolved.
Or, if they did have a written document it
hadn't been put before the
people for them, ordinary farmers, for
them to, to vote on it.
in, in Athens, for example.
The lawgivers solon hands down the law to
the people.
It's not voted for as a piece of paper by
the Athenians.
So, never in the ancient world was there
a de, a fully democratic constitution
making process.
And, the American Revolution in 1776,
the Declaration of Independence wasn't put
to
a popular vote.
And none of the state constitutions in
1776 as the former British colonies became
independent states.
None of those was put to a popular vote in
1776.
The British constitution had never been so
called, it's not a written document.
It's not one, and the British constitution
is
all the customs and practices and
traditions and institutions
that had never reduced to one single
document
and adopted by Parliament much less The
British people.
So, so this is a pretty new idea under the
sun to put all the
basic ground rules into a single document
that an ordinary person
could read, and then put it to in effect,
a special vote.
And the publishers understand that's a big
deal.
They, they see it from the beginning, and
they,
and they highlight the, the words of of
the preamble.
now, in 1780, the Massachusetts
Constitution had been
put to a pop popular vote, and, and in
1784.
New Hampshire had done the same.
But now what's being done is, this is
being done on a continental scale.
So these little dress rehearsals, in
Massachusetts and, and New Hampshire
are now being, being imitated on a
continental scale.
And here's A big point and the text
doesn't quite tell you this
that you need to know some history.
In eight of the thirteen states, that
ratified,
eventually ratified the Constitution, that
ordained and established it.
In eight of the thirteen ordinary property
qualifications were lowered or eliminated.
So, people ordinarily couldn't vote for
state legislature were allowed
to vote for convention delegates, or
people weren't ordinarily allowed to
serve in state legislatures were allowed
to serve in, as convention delegates.
So a much broader participation base than
ever before.
and, It's explosive.
It creates really as I say the modern
world.
Think about it.
Up and down the continent people getting
to vote.
And not just vote!
But talk.
They deliberated for you.
This is in the press.
Some people are for the thing, some people
are against it, and no one is shut down.
You can criticize George Washington if you
like.
You can support George Washington if you
like.
A massive
outpouring of freedom of speech, an
embodiment of freedom of speech.
That hadn't happened in 1776, really.
But you, in 1776, the British crown
monarch had,
had, had sent already 30,000 troops, over
to to America.
They were about to land.
And And you were either for the revolution
or you weren't, for independence or you
weren't.
And if you weren't, basically you were
told to shut up or leave.
Because this, this wasn't the philosophy
seminar, this was war.
And, and you either, you know, had to sort
of be for independence or fade away.
No one who opposed independence in 1776
Goes on to be an
important political figure in independent
America,
you're sort of voted off the island.
But in 1787-88, in this year that changed
everything, this preamble year,
there were people who opposed the
constitution,
vigorously, and they weren't voted off the
island.
Some of them would later become presidents
of the United States.
James Monroe, Vice-President, George
Clinton, Albritch Jerry,
justices on the Supreme Court, Samuel
Chase.
So its, its an extraordinary deed, this we
the
people of the United States do ordain and
establish
this Constitution for the United States of
America.
The fix wasn't in.
In some states the Constitution was
actually voted down.
North Carolina votes it down initially in
this year.
Rhode Island votes it down.
When George Washington takes office as the
first President
of the United States, only 11 states have
said yes.
We do, and the other States would join
later after a Bill of Rights.
Where did
we get the idea of a Bill of Rights
for example after a Bill of Rights had
been purposed
we get it from these 13 ratifying
conventions because
when you bring people together and you
allow them to
talk your in effect crowd sourcing that,
that, that
the Philadelphia draft that had emerged
and, and it effected
people State by State by State looked at
this
piece of paper and said Dudes, where are
the rights?
You forgot the rights.
The bill of rights comes from this
preamble process,
we the people up and down a continent
deciding whether we're for it or against
it.
And yes we're for it but we can improve
it, it needs
to get better, we need to add a, a bill of
rights.
And the bill of in effe-, it's, it's
almost like a wiki or something a version
2.0.
The constitution is crowd sourced.
In the ratification process.
And the Bill of Rights that emerges is a
Bill of Rights that will feature
the words the people in no fewer than five
of the 10 amendments.
You'll see that phrase, the people, in the
first amendment.
The right of the people to petition and
assemble.
And in the second amendment, the right of
the people to keep and bear arms.
And in the Fourth Amendment, and the Ninth
Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, why is it
saying, the people, the people, the
people, the
people, the people, in the Bill of Rights?
Because it's coming from the people.
It's coming from this Preamble process, a
process that was radically
inclusive and democratic for its Age.
Now, yes there were some exclusions, and
I'm
going to talk about those in the next
lecture.
Try to put them in some context.
There were some property qualifications in
some places.
Of course women didn't vote.
We're going to have to talk about slavery
a lot
in this course, and I promise you we will.
But for now I just want to end with a, a
couple
of observations just about how in this
context.
If you look at, if you judge this deed in
1787-88
by the standards of 1786 and 1785 and the
world that
had preceded it, it's the most democratic
deed in the history of planet Earth.
By far.
I want to end this lecture by reading to
you what the man who actually
drafted these words, we the people, at
Philadelphia had to say.
His name was James Wilson.
He was an immigrant kid from Scotland, a
scholarship kid.
Comes to America, becomes America's
greatest Lawyer.
He will, be asked by, George Washington to
be
a justice on the Supreme Court, the first
Supreme Court.
He will found the University of
Pennsylvania Law School,
and he drafts these words in Philadelphia,
we the people.
And when the thing
is finally ratified, A year later, July,
he's speaking on July
4, 1788, after at least nine states have
said yes, we do.
Here's what he says, to, 10,000
people gathered, gathered to celebrate in
Philadelphia.
The spectacle which we are assembled to
celebrate is the
most dignified one that has yet appeared
on our globe.
Namely a people free and enlightened.
Establishing and ratifying a system of
government.
Which they've previously considered,
examined, and approved.
You've heard of Sparta, of Athens, of
Rome.
You've heard of their admired
constitutions and their high prized
freedom.
But did they ever furnish the world an
exhibition similar to that which we now
contemplate?
Were their Constitution framed for those
who were appointed
for that purpose by the People after they
were framed.
Were they submitted to the consideration
of the People?
Had the People an opportunity
of expressing their sentiments concerning
them?
Were they to stand or fall by the peoples'
approving or rejecting vote?
The people, the people, the people.
You see here an early version of the
Gettysburg Address.
We've created a government of the people,
for the people, from the people.
The people are getting a chance to ordain
and establish this constitution.
And the world will
never be the same.
