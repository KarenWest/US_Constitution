Welcome back.
We're in the middle of a discussion
of Article III of the constitution, the
Judiciary
article, and we've been talking about
something
that modern people refer to as judicial
review.
The power and indeed the duty of judges to
refuse
to enforce laws that they
in their independent judgement deem
unconstitutional.
Even though those laws have been passed by
the House of
Representatives and the Senate, signed by
a President or passed
over Presidents veto.
Even though these laws have been duly
enacted in a procedural sense, judges have
the power and indeed the duty
to, to refuse to enforce those laws if
they deem them unconstitutional.
We call that judicial review.
It's not something that's explicitly
in the Constitution in so many words, but
I think it's
a deep part of the Constitution's overall
text, read holistically, and structure.
The argument is not that because there's a
thing called the Supreme Court in
the Constitution, the supreme law that
judges
on the Supreme Court have some unique
power.
The ju-, the Justices on the Supreme
Court are generally supreme over the other
judges.
There's a kind of a, a judicial pyramid.
Supreme Court justices can overturn courts
of appeals and below them trial courts
but, the Supreme Court is
not really supreme over the other
branches, just over the other courts.
And this power of, of holding something
refu-, unconstitutional, of refusing
to give effect for something that you
think is unconstitutional, is not
limited to sup-, the Supreme Court.
It's true of all other federal judges,
it's true of state judges.
We're going to see, to some extent, that
at
the founding, people thought it was true
of jurors.
The power to refuse to give effect to
some, something that you deem
unconstitutional is, is
a power, as we've seen, shared in some
ways by other branches of government as
well.
The House can just say no and refuse to
vote for a law
it thinks is unconstitutional, even if it
knows the courts
would uphold it or have upheld a very
similar law.
So too would the Senate.
Presidents can veto laws that say, that
they believe are unconstitutional.
Call that even if courts would uphold
those laws or have upheld them.
Think of Andrew Jackson refusing to sign a
new
bank bill even after John Marshall's
Supreme Court had,
had upheld the constitutionality of the
Federal Bank in McCullough vs Maryland.
Presidents can even refuse to enforce
certain bills that they
think are unconstitutional, at least until
a court case materializes.
There's a kind of executive review in the
Constitution alongside judicial review.
and, remember Presidents are made
independent of the Legislature too.
They're not picked just by the ordinarily,
just by, by the, the Legislature.
They're picked to the independent
Electoral College system.
They have undiminishable salary and indeed
their salary can't be increased either.
Judges can be increased, so they're
vulnerable to possible congressional
bribery, but
presidential salaries within a four-year
term
can be neither increased or decreased.
They've got a term of office independent
of
the Legislature, four years rather than
for life.
But there is a thing called executive
review really along side judicial review.
Remember that Thomas Jefferson is going to
pardon
everyone that he that has been convicted
under a
sedition act even after Supreme Court
justices writing
circuit have upheld this judicial act
against constitutional challenge.
So the basic argument for what we
call judicial review is not necessarily
something unique
about the judiciary, it simply follows
from, from two basic facts.
One, the constitution is the supreme law
of the land.
It trumps an ordinary statute, whether
congressional statute or state statute.
Why is it the supreme law of the land?
because it comes more authentically from
the people, it's a
more democratic law than a law passed by
an ordinary Congress.
So, the Constitution and its amendments
come more directly from the people.
Amendments are much more difficult to
adopt than ordinary statutes.
And so, because an amendment was hard to
adopt, it should
be hard to change, an ordinary statute
should not suffice to,
in affect, undo an amendment that required
2 3rds of the
House, 2 3rds of the Senate, 3 4ths of the
states.
A much broader process generated the
constitution itself
and its amendments and so ordinary
statutes actually rank
lower in their democratic pedigree.
The Constitution is the supreme law of the
land.
That's the first step and the second step
is judges enforce law.
Judges are supposed to follow law.
And if the constitution is inconsistent
with
the statute, they're supposed to follow
the Constitution.
In the same way that if a valid federal
law is inconsistent with a state
statute they're supposed to follow the
valid
federal law, because the supremacy clause
actually in,
of the Constitution, which we'll talk
about in later lectures.
It's in Article VI.
It says the Constitution is the supreme
law, and then congressional statues, but
only ones that are consistent with
the Constitution in pursuance of the
Constitution.
And then below that, state constitutions
and state statutes and so on.
And that's the democratic hierarchy of
law, and judicial
review is basically just a recognition of
the supremacy of
the Constitution as the supreme law of the
land,
and the fact that judges are supposed to
enforce law.
Now that's the basic argument of the
Federalist No.
78 in support of what we call judicial
review.
It's a basic argument that you see in an
opinion
by John Marshall in 1803 for the court
called Marbury v.
Madison.
But exactly how robust a conception a of
judicial review did the Framers envision?
I suggest at the founding, it was rather
modest.
Here are a few reason for thinking so.
First, remember that the Constitution
doesn't
specify the size of the Supreme Court.
Now, if the supreme court was going to be
invalidating acts of Congress,
right and left it was going to be as
important as say as the President and
the veto process or something, you'd think
that the Framers
would have specified much more how many
justices there would be.
In the same way that they, there was a lot
of wrangling about the apportionment of
the House of Representatives,
apportionment of the Senate,
how the Electoral College was to be
structured.
If the Supreme Court was basically an
organ of national
power that was designed to make sure that
the states
complied with the Constitution then you
could
imagine the fr-, the Framers actually were
going to
leave to Congress a lot of power over the
size and shape of, of the court.
so, in the same way that Congress would
decide
how to structure a post office, how to
structure
the Treasury Department, Congress could
structure the judiciary as
an organ of national power to monitor the
states.
And by the way
that idea of monitoring, of the judicial
monitoring the states
is an idea that went back to the colonial
era.
When colonists passed laws in their
assemblies judges
in privy counsel could judges and other
officials o the central government could
invalidate Congressional
excuse me colonial laws.
And, and the Framers of the Constitution
thought that the state
legislatures actually sort of needed a
little bit of checking and monitoring.
A little bit of oversight from the new
central government that they were trying
to create.
They were trying to create, in effect,
that little bit of a
substitute for the review of colonial
statutes embodied in, in the privy
council.
And, indeed, early on John Marshall's
court
strikes down lots and lots of state laws.
He's, he's siding with the federal
government, his, he and his Supreme Court.
John Marshall, invalidating state laws as
violative
of federal statutes and the federal
Constitution.
So lots of invalidations of state laws.
Basically on Marshall's watch only one
invalidation
of a congressional statute, that's in
Marbury v.
Madison.
I think that's consistent with the idea
that the Supreme Court's size isn't
specified.
Now by the way, precisely because its size
isn't
specified, it's a portion that rules, it's
going to be
vulnerable eventually to a pro-slavery
tilt are because of
the 3 5ths clause, the Congress tilts
towards the South.
Because of the 3 5ths
clause, the Presidency tilts towards the
South.
Pro-slavery Presidents like Andrew Jackson
eventually
become sort of dominant and they
can appoint pro-slavery judges and they
can sign into law pro-slavery
apportionment rules.
By the time of the Dred Scott case in the
1850s, the
Supreme Court is apportioned, but even
though the slave holding south has less
than a third of America's free population,
it has more than the,
it has a majority on the Supreme Court, so
it's kind of malapportioned.
And, and that's going to create some
problems, that
when that malapportioned court gives us
the Dred Scott case.
The original Supreme Court had six
members, an even number.
How odd.
Because you see if it's supposed
to be deciding all the important
constitutional issues,
you would imagine that you'd want an odd
number so that four could be three or
five could, could trump four, but
originally it's six.
That's another sign that they're not
imagining, the Framers are, the Supreme
Court as a kind of massive force it's
become in American history.
Here's another little clue.
When Presidents veto bills, they are
supposed to
actually give a written statement of
reasons for
vetoing the bill, send a message back to
Congress, and the Constitution prescribes
all of that.
And many of the early veto messages are,
are in fact
based on constitutional objections, as we
talked about in earlier lectures.
About half of the early vetoes, roughly
two dozen out of 50 say
in the antebellum, in the Pre-Civil War
period,
roughly half of them are constitutional
vetoes and
the Constitution is imagining, the Framers
were imagining
the veto as an important mechanism of
constitutional oversight.
A check and balance of the legislature,
but judicial opinions not so much.
There's nothing in the written
Constitution that says that judicial
opinions
even have to be written in the way that
the veto messages.
There's nothing that says there has to be
an opinion of the court and indeed,
before John Marshall comes along, there
isn't
actually an opinion of the court as such.
Individual justices kind of give their
opinions from
the bench randomly and sometimes there's
someone to
write it down, not always the, the, their
opinions, so are not collective, they're
not immediately published.
John Marshall is going to change all
of that.
But that's yet another signal that early
ju-, that, that the Framers
did not quite imagine judicial review to
be as robust as it becomes.
In all of Marshall's time on the court, he
strikes down one federal statute.
It's in a case called, Marbury v.
Madison.
He strikes down lots of state statutes,
but only one federal statute.
And that federal statute is regulating the
judiciary itself
the flaw in the statute, as Marshall saw
it,
was that the statute improperly expanded
the original jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court, giving them cases to
hear at
trial that they should instead have been
hearing on appeal.
So a very technical issue involving the
judiciary itself.
That's, the only time before 1850 that the
Supreme Court invalidates an act of
Congress even though, it's invalidating
lots and lots of state laws, as I said.
And even though Presidents are vetoing all
sorts of bills on constitutional
grounds, and they're vetoing bills that
courts have upheld or would uphold.
See, for example Jackson's veto of the
bank.
Presidents are pardoning people that
courts have
actually said don't have a good defense.
Thomas Jefferson's pardon of people who
were accused of violating the sedition
act.
So if all of that is so, the judiciary
originally
is sort of more a branch of the central
government
monitoring states, making sure that states
comply with the Constitution,
and with valid federal laws, by the way
that's McCulloch v.
Maryland.
Upholding a congressional scheme and
invalidating federal bank, a state
effort to tax that bank and undo it, so
that's paradigmatic of the Martial Court.
John Martial, a former congress person
himself, siding with Congress
against the states, and in so doing kind
of carrying forward
a theme from the Colonial experience of,
of, of members of the central government
monitoring local compliance with
Empire-wide, continent-wide rules.
So, if,
if that's early style judicial review with
only
one important invalidation of an act of
Congress by the Supreme Court, and that
enact involves the judiciary itself, how
is it...
And by the way state courts in the early
Revolutionary
Period had exercised judicial review ag-,
by invalidating state
statutes, which are seen as violating,
that were seen as violating state
constitutions.
But most of those early examples of state
style judicial review involved
judiciary specific laws, laws about juries
for example.
So how is it then you might ask that this
founding judiciary, the least dangerous
branch, third out of three,
pretty modest doesn't get to pick it's own
subordinates?
Supreme Court Justices can't pick lower
court judges.
Doesn't get to pick his own leaders.
Justices can't pick the, the chief justice
doesn't get to
some absolute right to regulate his own
procedures or evidence.
It's, it's shape can be manipulated by
Congress.
You, Congress can add to it, or subtract
from
the size of the justices if they don't
like the,
the rulings of the current justices.
If all of that is so, how is it
that the judiciary has become much more
powerful over time?
Supreme in some sense arguably.
Even over other branches, or at least
some supreme court justices think that,
and ordinary
people think that, that there's a unique
power
and duty of courts and among them, the
Supreme Court, and court judges more than
juries to
say what the law is and enforce the
Constitution.
Well, I think a few factors are at play.
And let's just talk about them and their
post-founding factors.
One, a lot more judges today.
At the founding, there are only 15 lower
court judges.
And there, there soon become 105 or so
members of the House of Representatives.
Seven congresspeople
for every, seven representatives for every
judge.
Today there are about two federal judges
for every member of the House of
Representatives.
That’s a a 15-fold increase in the, the
ratio of judges to members of Congress.
Today lawyers, young lawyers are much more
likely to start their
careers clerking for a judge than
interning for a member of Congress.
So one thing, the judiciaries become
powerful just
because there are a lot more of them.
You know, the old joke, friends come and
go, but enemies accumulate.
Well, judges accumulate.
And the Supreme Court sits atop this even
increasing pyramid where we have
more laws, more complex laws, we meed
mor-, need more judges to implement them.
A huge, judicial pyramid, with all with
radiating power in various districts.
You may be more likely to know a Federal
Judge than than your own member
of the House of Representatives.
Congress can't expand infinitely.
Congress has about 500 people now, 435 in
the house.
If it were 4,000, it would be even more
dysfunctional than at 400.
And if it were 40,000, you know all the
more.
Judges you can keep expanding that
pyramid.
So that's one thing that happened.
Second thing that happened is judges got
control over their docket.
A thing called certiorari, the justices
could decide which cases that were
going to here, and, and that gives
them the power, the effect to define a
kind of legislative agenda.
In the early period, almost all the
important issues, actually, are resolved
outside the judiciary.
Should there should there, can Presidents
fire cabinet officers at will?
Can the federal government assume state
war debts?
Is a bank of the United States
Constitution.
And that doesn't reach the Supreme Court
until 30
years after the founding debates about all
of this.
Can Presidents negotiate treaties
secretly?
Can they issue neutrality proclamations?
Is the Sedition Act unconstitutional?
Issue after issue after issue the, the big
ones don't
come before the Supreme Court.
On the Sedition Act for example, the
Supreme Court doesn't
have, as such, appellate jurisdiction over
all federal criminal cases.
And it only gets that late in the 19th
Century.
Justices are riding circuit and and
deciding cases individually,
but not quite as a Supreme Court.
So, more judges, that's one answer.
Second they have, they get to hear more
cases,
these restrictions on their jurisdiction
are gradually, gradually fall away, they
have more, the Supreme Court has more
control over its docket.
It now sits atop a huge pyramid of, of
federal judges so all, all who
can be seen as just so many lieutenants
enforcing Supreme Court mandates.
We have a series of amendments that are
designed with judicial review in mind.
To, to create judicially enforceable
rights.
Especially after the Civil War.
Rights against states and the federal
government.
And the courts were very vigilant in
enforcing rights against states, as we've
seen.
That's going to be the story of the
reconstruction amendments.
We have the emergence of divided
government in the 20th century.
So, when the Congress is controlled by
different party than the President they
are at loggerheads, and
so courts can do lots more stuff, and no
matter
what they do they're not going to get
invalidated because either
the President will like it, or the
Congress will like it.
And either the president or the Congress
can stop any law that
would try to retaliate against the
justices, or overturn their controversial
decision.
So in a world of unified government, where
the House, the
Senate, and the Presidency, are all
dominated by the same party,
judges have less ability to sort of smack
down political actions.
Because they can, in turn, be retaliated
against by a unified House,
Senate, Presidency, but in the modern era,
we don't have that so much.
We have post-Watergate and Vietnam, a
sense
that our political branches have lied to
us.
And the courts actually have been part of
the,
the solution, the, the Nixon tapes case,
the Pentagon papers case.
So Presidents are seen now as partisan
officials and that wasn't true of George
Washington.
Whereas justices have positioned
themselves as,
as sort of more above party.
Whether that's true or not that's actually
the, the, the, the persona.
so, so a
whole bunch of reasons, I think, why
judges today are much
more powerful than before and many, many
more acts of judicial review.
In the modern era the Supreme Court, about
twice a year,
is invalidating, three times a year, is
invalidating Act of Congress.
The entire period, before 1850, there was
one invalidation
of an act of congress, that's called
Marbury v.
Madison, it was
a judiciary specific law.
So so today, as I said, in the modern era
the court every year is, is
as robust against Congress or more than in
the entire period before 1850.
So we've talked a bit about judges.
Let me tell you a couple more things about
Article III.
It gives judges power to hear all federal
cases, and it's not at all clear
that Congress can take that power away
from federal courts.
It may be able to reallocate, give power
to
one federal court or another court, but
Congress is
limited in its ability to take away all
federal
cases of a certain sort from the federal
judiciary.
So said John Marshall's court in an
important case called Martin v.
Hunter's Lessee.
And let
me just say a word or two, about juries
and then
I'm going to come back to the picture of
John Marshall.
I've been talking about judges a lot,
cause today, judges are the main event.
When we say Article III, we think judges,
but for
the Framers juries were a lower house of a
bicameral judiciary.
They were an important part of the
process.
They are mentioned in Article III.
Criminal cases have to be tried under a
jury in Article III.
The anti-federalists
said that's not enough, we want more
protections for juries.
What about civil juries, you're not
specifying that the jury for
example has to come from a certain
district or, or vicinage so
we need more protections for juries than
you are recognizing.
Even Marbury v.
Madison, by the way, can be thought of as
involving jury rights.
Why would not want the original
jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court to be expanded?
Because the Supreme Court's going to be
sitting in Washington, DC and and
if it gets to hear a case, then a local
jury isn't participating.
But if instead the Supreme Court doesn't
hear the case and some other lower
federal court hears it in the hinterlands,
there's going to be a local jury involved.
So, the whole debate about
the Bill of Rights in the ratification
process, when that, when critics say hey,
you forgot the rights, is precipitated in
part by a criticism of Article III.
Saying you know, it mentions juries but
not robustly enough.
Not civil juries, not enough protection
for jurors.
It mentions criminal procedure, it says an
impeachment.
Excuse me, in for treason it says that
things have to
happen in open court and there have to be
two witnesses
to a treason.
But what about all the other rights of, of
criminal defendants?
What about rights of council, and against
double jeopardy,
and the right not to be compelled to
incriminate yourself?
And so on.
It says treason can only will consist only
of levying war against the United States.
Its kind of a protection therefor of free
speech.
You can't be prosecuted for treason merely
for
criticizing the government, but you did
say that explicitly.
Why isn't there more protection of free
speech and free expression?
So, this treason clause which can be seen
as a kind of proto Bill
of Rights, the jury provisions of Article
III, which can be seen of as
a seed crystal of a Bill of
Rights precipitated conversation saying,
you know we
need a lot more rights and, and that's
going to lead to a Bill of Rights.
So Article III is in some
ways a gateway to the early amendments.
Now before I conclude, I just
wanted to come back, because I promised I
would, to this picture that, that's begins
chapter six of of America's
Constitutional: A Biography.
Every chapter begins with a picture, and
if you understand the picture, you'll
understand election.
This is John Marshall, he is the great
early Chief Justice, and before he comes
along
the Supreme Court actually is practically
impotent.
And he makes it, the Supreme Court.
After Marshall the Justices are going to
speak
actually with an opinion of the Court,
which
the constitution doesn't require, and
they're going to
issue written opinions which the
constitution doesn't require.
So his kind of counterpart to the
President's veto message.
And he is going to invalidate all sorts of
state laws that
are inconsistent with the federal scheme.
But he's not going to pick too many
fights with congress, because he's
going to lose that.
His branch isn't as powerful.
It is the least dangerous to begin with.
He's himself a former congressperson, a
former diplomat, very
popular, and he helps establish judicial
review in Marbury v.
Madison, but he doesn't push it too far.
In general he's, his court is going to be
upholding
federal exercises of power, like the
federal bank,
and invalidating state laws that interfere
with that.
He is going to give us the idea of a
modern Supreme Court.
He's going to stick around for a very long
time,
showing you that life tenure, this good
behavior, means something.
Before him Chief Justices left early.
They didn't have to, but they chose to
leave early.
So just as Washington establishes a
tradition, that the
presidency, although he can be re-elected
again and again, Presidency should
end after two terms, so kind of a gloss on
Article II.
Marshall establishes a gloss on Article
III.
No life tenure means that judges shouldn't
leave early.
They should stick around to the end.
So, in earlier
lectures, I said well, if you understand
George Washington, you see a lot
about the early presidency.
If you understand Andrew Jackson, you see
what the presidency became.
If you see Henry Clay, you see congress as
a great speechifying body.
So, three, three big themes about the
constitution have emerged early on.
And if you see John Marshall, he embodies
the, the power of the early of
the supreme court, that, that, that he
helps actualize.
It's not as clear in the text, but he
makes it real.
What are the three big themes of our story
so far?
The constitution is more democratic than
we've been told, more
pro-slavery than we've been told, and more
about national security.
Who's John Marshall?
He's a very before he was on the Supreme
Court,
he's a very popular politician.
A man of the people.
Probably the most popular member of his
party, the Federalist Party
in America.
Especially after Hamilton's death.
So a former politician, becoming a judge.
So you see its sort writing for ordinary
people, writing opinions that
ordinary people can understand, so a
master practitioner of a kind of of,
of, of democratic politics.
He's from Virginia.
A slave holding regime and but he's a
critic of slavery.
And we're going to come back to that in,
in a minute.
he, he doesn't think that slavery is this
great thing, and in that
way he's like Washington, like Thomas
Jefferson, who's his cousin by the way.
He's also one of America's leading
diplomats.
He understands national security.
He comes to national prominence in part as
a diplomat in France.
And he is a hero of the American
Revolution.
He's there with George Washington, he's
there at Valley Forge.
He writes famous opinions upholding nation
security powers of the federal government,
a national bank.
So democracy, slavery, national security
all embodied in the person of John
Marshall.
Now, just as George Washington, who was a
slaveholder but who frees his
slaves and thinks slavery is basically
going to to be the death of the republic.
It ultimately succeeded by Andrew Jackson,
who was much more pro-slavery
and, in fact at least as a constitutional
matter and will support
the slave power.
So John Marshall is going to be succeeded
by
Roger Taney, whose constitutional vision
is much more pro-slavery.
Who puts Taney on the court?
Andrew Jackson.
How does Andrew Jackson become President?
The 3 5ths clause.
So, Marshall is a Virginian who is a
critic of slavery, doesn't want this to be
a slave-holding republic forever.
He is succeeded, though, by Taney,
whose Constitutional vision is much
more enthusiastically pro-slavery, a
Jackson appointee.
And because of that, the Dred Scott case
a man named Lincoln will arise and say the
Constitution is, is
skewing far too much in a pro-slavery
direction, we have to stop this.
And the confrontation between Lincoln's
vision and Taney's
vision will eventually culminate in the
Civil War.
And the Constitution will be transformed
in the process.
But that's basically the story for, for
later lectures.
I promise I'll tell that story to you.
So stay tuned.
