Welcome back.
We're in the middle of a discussion of
Article Four in the Constitution and
we left off talking briefly about the
famous case of Dred Scott v Sandford,
a case from 1857, in which the US Supreme
Court held, among other things, that
free blacks could never be citizens, even
if their state called them citizens.
And even if they voted in their states and
their
father voted and was and their fathers
voted in states
and their grandfathers, didn't matter,
said, said Taney, because he
said, Constitution presupposed that only
whites, in effect, could be citizens.
Or at the very least, people descended
from African slaves
couldn't be Citizens, no, the Constitution
doesn't say that all.
Taney basically is making some of that
stuff up.
What arguments did he give?
Well, he gave some historical arguments
that of course the framers for the
Constitution did not
contemplate, blacks as, as equal citizens,
but that's just false.
They absolutely did and actually in, in
Massachusetts they made a
big deal of the fact that blacks were,
were equal citizens.
And they rejected a state constitution, a
proposed
constitution in 1778 precisely because it
had race tests.
Well, here's another thing that he said.
Gee, if blacks were citizens that would
mean that they could come
from the north down to the South and they
would be entitled
to all the privileges and immunities
of citizens and those privileges and
immunities
would include, for example, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly the
right of freedom of religious worship, the
right to have guns and carry them around.
In other words he thought that the
privileges and immunities of citizens
basically included stuff that today we
would call the Bill of Rights.
Stay tuned on that
one, we're going to talk a lot about the
Bill of Rights and how
it originally applied only against the
federal government and eventually came to
be
applied against the states, thanks to the
fourteenth amendment that uses the same
words that you first see in Article
Four, privileges, immunities, citizens, so
stay tuned.
But the thing to remember about Article
Fouris it didn't
quite tell you that if you went from one
state
to another and you were a citizen that you
got
to carry with you all the rights of your
home state.
Not quite.
What did it say?
It said that the new state, the state that
you were traveling into, couldn't treat
you as an outsider.
They had to treat you as an insider.
But treating you as an insider doesn't
necessarily
mean that you're going to get everything
you want.
Here's what it does mean.
That if if
a person who's just, say I'm, I'm a
Connecticut person.
I go to New York.
If a person who's just like me happens to
be from New York,
can own a piece of property, then I can
own that piece of property.
If they can open up a business, then I can
open up a business.
If they can have free speech, or religious
worship, then I can do that.
New York has to treat me, when I'm
visiting New York, basically
as a New Yorker for almost all purposes,
for purposes of civil rights.
There's a limit.
They don't have to let me vote in a New
York election
or serve in a New York legislature or a
jury or militia.
Political rights are excluded from the
privileges and
immunities that New York has to give me.
Civil rights, yes.
Political rights like voting, no.
But what civil rights do they have to give
me?
Equal Civil Rights with their own folks.
So for example, if a woman, let's, let's
imagine that a state that,
that, a woman goes from Connecticut to New
York.
Now does she get to vote in New York?
Of course not.
Because, actually no one just visiting New
York gets to vote, but also
because New York women don't get to vote
in, in the the 19th Century.
If the rule, for example, is that married
women
in New York don't get to own real property
in
their own name, because they're, they're,
they're married, well, then
a Connecticut woman who goes to New York
wouldn't get to
own real property in her own name if she
were married,
because she just has to be treated as a
New Yorker.
So Taney was afraid that if blacks went
down to the
South, they'd have to be able to the right
to have guns
because if they had the right to have guns
in Massachusetts and
free speech in Massachusetts and, and
religious liberty in Massachusetts or
Connecticut
when they went down to South Carolina that
they get all those rights.
No what they would get is the rights of
South Carolina free blacks, which might
not be very extensive.
So they would basically have the right
be treated as South Carolinians, and be
treated,
and, and so Article Four was basically
a ban on discriminating against
out-of-staters as such.
Discriminating against someone one just
because they
were from Connecticut rather than New
York.
So, Article Four when it talks about
privileges and immunities
of citizens, is just a kind of of
inter-state equality idea.
There's some other inter-state ideas in
Article Four, somewhat similar if
a state court renders a judgment between
two people in, in Connecticut.
A sues B, A wins, B has to pay up.
Then New York is supposed to give that
state judgment full faith and credit, and
especially after Congress implemented that
in a
statute, and Article Four provided for
Congressional implementation.
That meant that if, if A sued B and A won,
and B basically
doesn't have very much, very many assets
in New York, excuse me, in Connecticut.
A sues B in
Connecticut and B loses, but all of B's
money and, and,
and property is in almost all of it is in
New York.
A can go over and get New York courts to,
to basically follow that judgment
and, and, and use B's assets in New York
to satisfy that Connecticut judgment.
New York is supposed to give Connecticut
judgments full faith and credit.
Treat a Connecticut judgment the same way,
in effect, it would treat a New York
judgment, in which it would generally give
that New York judgment full
effect, full faith and, and credit.
Okay.
So we've begun to talk about race and who
counts as a citizen.
Unfortunately, the Constitution isn't
crystal clear on what it means to be
a citizen.
And the 14th amendment is going to solve
that problem in its first sentence
by saying everyone born in the United
States is a citizen, whether you're born
black or white, Jew or gentile, male or
female gay or straight.
We're all born Equal citizens and that's
going to be an
important idea, that the Fourteenth
Amendment's going to add, because the
Constitution talked about citizenship but
wasn't completely clear on what it meant.
Women for example, and here's what it
didn't mean, it didn't
mean, in order to be a citizen, you didn't
have to vote.
Women, for example, didn't vote at the
founding,
but they were treated as citizens under
Article Four.
They got to sue and be sued in court under
diversity jurisdiction which
is a provision of Article III that says
citizens of one state can sue
citizens of another state, and women were
always counted for that purpose.
So, to be a citizen doesn't mean you get
to vote.
You're born a citizen if you're born in
the United States on
the day of your birth, but that doesn't
mean you're a voter.
You get, in effect, civil rights, but not
political rights.
You have all sorts of rights but not
necessarily rights to to vote
or to hold office, or to serve in a jury
or a legislature.
Those political rights are, are treated as
different from
the general civil rights of citizens.
Think about a woman, an unmarried white
woman has all sorts of rights to, in most
states, of, of religious worship, of free
speech
she can own property in her own name.
But she has all sorts of civil rights, but
not political rights.
Not yet.
Stay tuned, we're going to figure out,
we're going to find out how and
when women did get political rights later
in, in our lecture series.
So we've
been talking about race and slavery a
little bit.
Slavery and race is not one issue, it's
six or seven or eight.
It's the status of free blacks, and
whether they
can be citizens, so we've been talking
about that.
It's a question of how slaves are
going to be counted for the House of
Representatives.
We talked about that, the 3/5th clause,
how
slaves are going to be accounted for
presidential elections.
Well, the same 3/5ths
clause feeds into the electoral college.
It's about runaway slaves, what happens if
people from
one state where slavery is legal, escape
and, and venture
into another state, the fugitive slave
issue, and we're about
to talk about that, because Article Four
talks about that.
It's slavery, also we're going to need to
talk about slavery in the territories.
That's a different issue and in fact,
that's going to be the issue over which
the
Union basically breaks in the 1850s and
60s, the issue of slavery in the
[UNKNOWN].
It's about an international slave trade.
And remember, Congress can't prohibit the
importation of slaves before 1808,
but is allowed to prohibit the importation
of slaves after 1808.
So, slavery, again, isn't one issue.
It's a whole series of issues and it's
kind of connected, and my big claim is
going to be that the Framers failed in a
way by by not using the 1808 idea more.
Okay, we're going to concede all sorts of
things
to pro-slavery folks today, but after 1808
or
1828 or 1876 or 1878 or whatever, after a
certain point no more concessions, no more
slave importations, no more slavery in the
West, no
more fugitive slave rendition, no more
extra credit for extra
slaves in the house, no more extra credit
for
extra slaves in the electoral college et
cetera, et cetera.
And maybe at some point no more slavery
after a certain point.
Slavery shall end, even in the States,
because yet another issue is slave,
slavery in the states and does Congress
have the power to, to regulate that.
And the answer is not quite
under the original Constitution.
So, slavery isn't one issue, it's a
series.
And let's talk about a couple of the other
issues that are front and center in
Article Four.
One is the fugitive slave clause.
So, under that clause
if someone runs away is a, is a lawful
slave in, in one state, say South
Carolina, runs away,
escapes into a free state, say
Massachusetts, what does Massachusetts
have to do?
And the Articles of Confederation didn't
have an answer to this.
English law basically said, in effect,
could be
read to say, well, once you make it
to free soil, once you make it to
England, basically, we're not going to
enforce the slavery.
Maybe we're not going to declare you
completely free and if somehow you went
back to, to South Carolina, maybe slavery
might reattach.
But while you're in English soil, we're
not going to let you be in chains.
Maybe, you owe an apprenticeship or
something, but
no slavery will be allowed on English
soil.
It won't be hereditary, maybe
apprenticeship or something like that,
or indenture, but no slavery, because
English soil is free soil.
So said a famous English case,
Somersett's case, and that would have been
the rule I think in the United States.
The background rule of, of choice of law,
of conflicts in law.
What's the general rule?
The general rule is when in Rome do as the
Romans, the law of the place.
In Wyoming, you're allowed to drive 80
miles an
hour, maybe, but when you come to
Connecticut, it's 55.
so, and if you want to drive 80, go back
to Wyoming.
Slavery might be legal in some places but
not in others, and if a slave
escapes, you know, then, then, to a free
place then it's the law of freedom.
That's what the background rule might have
been understood to
provide, but Article Four says no, a slave
state, a a
free state, not first can't free the
fugitive slave, can't
declare the person officially free, they
have to give basically they
have to respect the slave state's law on
this.
Not only can't they officially free the
fugitive, they have to actually
send the fugitive back to the slave
jurisdiction if they're
convinced that the person is really a
fugitive slave, as opposed
to a free black person in the case of
mistaken identity, or
someone whom been previously freed,
previously emancipated in the slave
jurisdiction.
So they only have to send them back, if
they really are, a fugitive slave.
And in that way, it could be seen as a bit
of a compromise between slave state
interest and free state interest.
The slave states, basically, get their
slave back but the free
states get to apply their own procedures
for
determining whether this person really is
an alleged fugitive.
And, by the way
if you didn't have that provision, there's
another provision of
Article Four that says, anyone charged
with a crime by
one state has to be extra, who's found in
another
state has to be extradited back to the
charging state.
And, and, and, and if you didn't have
fugitive slave clause, maybe the South
could have said, okay, fine, we are
going to charge this person with a crime.
We are going to charge the person with the
crime of having stolen
the horse that he escaped on, because that
was the
master's horse, having stolen the clothes
and the shoes that he
was wearing because that was the master's
clothes and the
master's shoes, having stolen himself,
because he himself is slave property.
And it, it, and, and, and, under the,
fugitive
from justice provision, the criminal
justice provision, the Northern
state would've just had to send them back
down
South for adjudication as to whether to
they really committed
those crimes.
But the fugitive slave class, I think,
fairly read, said no, actually the
Northern states are going to get a little
bit more as part of this bargain.
They're going to be able to decide for
themselves whether
the person is truly a fugitive slave or
not.
At least that how you could have read the
Constitution, in a, in, in pro-freedom
ways, anti-slavery ways.
The Taney court is going to read these
provisions in very pro-slavery ways.
They're going to actually insist that
Northern states send people, alleged
fugitive slaves, sort of back without
being able to follow fair procedures.
They're going to uphold Congressional
laws, implementing
the fugitive slave clause, even though
there's
no express power in Article Four for
Congress to implement the fugitive state
clause.
But, but Congress passes laws, and the Law
of 1850 is going to say the alleged
fugitive,
he's only alleged, can't testify in
the Northern proceeding, can't call
witnesses, doesn't
have a lawyer, and, and the judge who
decides that, the magistrate will
be paid more if he decides the person's a
fugitive slave then if
he decides the person is free, in a case
of mistaken identity something.
So it's a dreadful law, the North is
really going to rebel against it.
It's going to be one of the precipitating
factors in the civil war, the fugitive
slave
clause, which gets implemented in
pro-slavery ways.
It's, it's pro-slavery in it's bones to
some extent, but it gets implemented
in even more aggressively pro-slavery ways
by Congress and the Taney court.
But the real issue that precipitates the
Civil War, the real race and slavery
issue, isn't the fugitive slave issue.
There are not that many fugitive slaves.
It's the issue of slavery in the
territories.
Before I say, and, and, and that's an
issue that was involved in the Dred Scott
case.
In the Dred Scott case, the slave,
Dred Scott from Missouri, is taken by his
master to free
soil in the North, Union territory and
then returns to Missouri and he says he's
been
freed because his master took him onto
free soil.
Now you might wonder why the fugitive
slave clause didn't apply in this
situation.
Dred Scott didn't run away.
He wasn't a fugitive.
So, so his master voluntarily took him
onto Northern free soil.
And so the fugitive slave clause.
So that's yet another issue the issue we
talk
about all of the issues of slavery, here's
another one.
What about some one voluntarily, a master
voluntarily
taking a slave from slave soil to free
soil.
Well, here is what the Constitution says
about that in Article Four.
Congress has sweeping power to regulate
the federal territories.
And Congress, exercising that power in the
first Congress, said no, no slavery
in the Northwest Territory, north of the
Ohio River, that's federal territory.
It's not yet a state, but there won't be
slavery allowed there.
And and everyone who voted for the
Constitution understood that that could
happen, anticipated that.
People like James Wilson actually bragged
that that's what, what would happen.
That's what did happen.
So there's no rule in the Constitution
that
Congress has to allow slavery in the
territories.
Basically, Congress gets to choose it
could have been even more pro-freedom.
It could have said no slavery in the
territories will be permitted, no slavery
after 1808 will be permitted or after 1828
in the territories, it didn't say that.
It said Congress
can choose.
But in the Dred Scott, and that, and
Congress did choose to eliminate slavery
from the
Northwest Territory in one of the very
first
statutes Congress ever passed, the
Northwest Ordinance Act.
I guess the seventh or eighth statute
passed by Congress in 1789.
And Congress will later exclude slavery
from an area north of a certain
line in the Missouri Compromise but
Taney's going to come along in Dred
Scott and say you know what those free
soil laws are unconstitutional.
Congress cannot basically prohibit slavery
in the territories.
The territories have to be places
where Southern slaveholders can take their
slaves.
Now, this was preposterous.
It was just making all that up, and
Lincoln
thought it was preposterous.
Now, Congress doesn't even have the power
to exclude slavery from the territories.
Presumably, Congress doesn't even have the
power to let
the territories decide for themselves,
Stephen Douglas's popular sovereignty
solution.
So in one stroke, in 1857, the Supreme
Court basically says, Abe Lincoln
and the Republican Party's idea of
excluding
slaves from the territories, that's
unconstitution, unconstitutional.
It affects Stephen Douglas' strategy of
letting the territories decide for
themselves.
That's unconstitu, pop so-called Populist
sovereignty, that's unconstitutional.
This is going to precipitate a civil war.
but, blame Tawney for that.
Don't blame Article Four because Article
Four actually doesn't say that.
It gives Congress sweeping power over
their territories, and Congress originally
exercises that in very pro-freedom
ways, free soil for the Northwest
Territory.
The Northwest Territory is worth
remembering
for yet another reason, because it
sets a template for how the West is going
to be treated.
It says these territories will eventually
become states,
admitted on equal terms with the, the 13
original states.
So, this idea which is also provided for
in Article Four, that Congress is going to
have power to admit new states, is one
of the, the radically Democratic features
of the Constitution.
Article Four doesn't quite require
doesn't, doesn't have a detailed
regulation on how these new states are
going to be admitted,
but, but the rest of the Constitution says
every state gets two senators.
So if that's true of the 13 old ones it's
going to be true of the new ones too.
And every state's going to be represented
in the House
of Representatives and part of the
Electoral College and so on.
So, the rest of the Constitution's deep
structure basically says
eventually, when these territories are
admitted
as states, they're going to be admitted in
effect on equal footing, and that's a
phrase that appears in the Northwest
Ordinance.
The new states are going to appear on
equal footing.
We are not going to be Lord over the west
as, as colonizers.
They won't be perpetual colonists.
We will not treat the West the way Britain
treated us.
A deep anti-imperialist
anti colonial vision in Article Four, as
implemented by the Northwest
Ordinance, that these territories are
going to come in on equal terms.
And
and here we see the geography idea of the
nation's going to
need to expand westward, and that's
going to give us a, a, buffer.
But the democratic idea as well.
They're going to come in ultimately on
equal terms.
And the slavery issue weren't, the
Congress is going to repent on that.
Congress will, will have the power to
decide.
One other feature of Article Four, and
then I'll sum up.
Article Four gives Congress the power to
insist, to guarantee
that each of the existing states be, have
a republican form of government.
Now by that they don't mean Republican as
opposed to Democratic, that
it has to have a state legislature as
opposed to initiative and referendum.
No, they mean Republican as opposed to
monarchical and aristocratic.
Republican and Democratic are two
different
ways of saying basically the same thing.
The party that we call the Democrat party,
Jackson's party, was founded by Jefferson
and and
Madison and they refer to it originally
as the Republican party, or the Republican
Democrats.
Pretty much the same thing, democratic
republican mean pretty
much the same thing, republican is Latin,
democratic is Greek.
They basically mean rule by the people.
Article Four says in two big things that
the new territories
are going to eventually be treated as
equal states, a very republican idea
no kind of colonial hierarchy, and that
Congress will have the power
to ensure that the existing state never
lapse into monarchies and aristocracies.
Why?
because if they do, they're going to
tyrannize their own people and this
is a federal guarantee actually that we
won't allow that to happen.
They're going to be threats to their
neighbors because, tyrannical regimes are
not only threats to their own people but
to their neighbors.
Think Saddam Hussein, think Adolf Hitler
and also
if these states don't have proper
republican governments, then the
building blocks of the Federal regime are
going to be compromised.
Because, these states are going to have
to elect Senators and Presidential
electors and
if Florida has crummy elections that's
going to
affect the electoral, the continental
electoral college.
So, Each state is going to have
to be, maintain minimum standards of
republicanism.
This clause in the Constitution is
going to,
become the most important clause of the
entire document after the Civil War.
It's going to be the clause by which the
North is
going to reconstruct the South and rebuild
them in to republican governments.
It's going to in effect treat the South
the way it has treated the West
making sure that the west has proper
republican governments before it's
admitted into the Union.
Well, when the South lapsed because of the
Civil War,
the North is going to sort of rebuild it
and make
sure they had proper republican
governments before they were readmitted.
So, this clause of the Constitution, the
Republican Government
clause, has been called the sleeping giant
of the Constitution.
It's going to reawaken and be the most
important provision after the Civil War.
I promised I was just going to say a word
or two about this political cartoon at the
end.
We see the great themes.
We see the idea of geostrategy, Join or
Die.
America at, these, these colonies border
on
each other; they actually have to work
together.
This is, a vision of the colonies sort of
working together.
So you see the geographic idea, and the
national security idea very powerfully in,
in this image
of course and that's Franklin's image.
Remember, of course, the other two great
themes that we've
been talking about in addition to this
national security idea.
The slavery idea.
Can South Carolina really get along with
New England given
that New England is anti-slavery and South
Carolina is pro-slavery?
That's going to be a big question.
And the Democratic idea.
Will this union hold,
if it's really divided against itself?
If it's, if some parts of
it are pro-slavery and fundamentally
anti-republican that,
that don't respect equality and free
speech and free press and religious
liberty.
That's ultimately going to be the crisis
of the house divided.
We're going to talk a lot about that in
later lectures, so stay tuned.
