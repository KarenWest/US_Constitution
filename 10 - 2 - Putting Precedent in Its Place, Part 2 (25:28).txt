Well, welcome back.
We've been talking about the role of
Judicial power in our Constitution.
It's a phrase that appears in the
Constitution.
The Constitution, the written
Constitution, contemplates a very
important
role for the Judiciary and we've been
trying to figure
out if there's some way of, harmonizing
the role of
the Judiciary with the basic precepts of,
of written Constitution.
We've talked about different aspects of
Judicial power, the
power to interpret the document to say
what it means.
To implement it to make it real in the
world
with all sorts of in court rules moving
from the abstract
meaning of the Constitutional text to a
bunch of rules
that courts and lawyers and lower courts
can understand and implement.
We've talked about the importance of
deciding the case a
thing called evase judicada, reaching a
judgment between the parties.
Of establishing certain precedents that
have a certain weight, and
of providing judicial remedies for the
violation of legal rights.
Let me say a little bit about remedies and
then I'm going
to come back to the bigger question of the
role of precedent.
I'll start with remedies and move to
precedent.
You might think I was pretty harsh back
in my Warren court discussion about the
Exclusionary Rule.
I think it's Constitutionally made up.
It's not in the written Constitution, and
it
doesn't really have proper foundations in
the unwritten Constitution.
One of the reasons I'm so emphatic, about,
this is, I need to give you at
least one example of where the unwritten
constitutionalism goes too far.
This is a game with rules.
And you can't just call anything the
unwritten Constitution.
And it seems to me that the Exclusion rule
is
a good illustration of where actually
judges not only went beyond
the Constitution, which they are allowed
to do, they need
to do it to do the job, but went too far.
I need to show you why that's so.
And I said, well it's not in the written
constitution, and it's not implicit in
the deep logic of the constitution, which
is
about protecting innocent people from
possibly erroneous conviction.
And the exclusionary rule protects guilty
people as such, qua-guilty people.
The only reason the defendant wants to
exclude this
evidence is that it caught them dead to
rights.
And in the process of excluding we impose
all
sorts of harms on victims and their, their
families intention
with deep ideas of truth seeking and a
public trial
that's all about actually sorting the
innocent from the guilty.
That's the deep implicit structure of the
constitution I
argued, so the Exclusionary rule isn't in
the written Constitution.
And it's not in the implicit Constitution,
reading between
the lines, because that's about truth
finding and innocence protecting.
That's the big idea, and those things
support Gideon versus Wainwright in
providing lawyers for indigent defendants,
but
not throwing out reliable evidence of
guilt.
I talked about how the Exclusionary rule
isn't really a part of our lived
Constitution.
It doesn't really bubble up from the
American people and their practices.
You know ordinary people actually believe
in, in
truth and sorting the innocent from the
guilty.
And unlike say Gideon that the Warren
court decision called Matt versus Ohio
was not merely following states that
had already pretty much established the
principle.
When it comes to attorneys, the paid
counsel for indigent defendants, the lived
practice
in America was to provide for that, even
before the Warren court came along.
Not so, with the exclusionary rule which
the Warren court applied against the
states.
So, I didn't think it was in the written
Constitution, in the
implicit Constitution in the lived
Constitution,
and you might say okay, Professor.
Isn't the Exclusionary rule a remedy?
When the Fourth Amendment's violation,
surely there must be a remedy.
For every right, there's a remedy.
And I say yes, for every right, there is a
remedy, and the framers believed in
that, and they built actually the, their
remedial
vision into the text of the Fourth
Amendment.
Which talks about the right of the people
to
be secure in their against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
What law, actually they say the right of
the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers and effects
against
unreasonable searches and seizures shall
not be violated.
Now what law makes, gives you security, in
your person, houses, papers, effects.
It's basically property law and tort law.
The government touches me, that's a
trespass and if anyone else
touches me, and in an improper way, I can
sue in trespass.
If people come onto my land breach invade
my house, that's a tort, that's a
trespass.
And I sued them and that's what the
framers of the Fourth
Amendment envisioned were Tort Suits
brought
by people who had been intruded upon.
And indeed, the most famous cases of the
Anglo American world at the
time of the Constitution, the OJ Simpson
case of the day, if you will.
The Brown versus Board of Education case
of the day involved actually lawsuits
brought against government bullies who had
improperly searched and seized.
The plaintiff in one of the lawsuits was a
man named John Wilkes
as in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania and
Wilkes
County, North Carolina, and Wilkes County,
Georgia.
The judge was a man named Camden, as
in Camden, Maine, Camden, South Carolina,
Camden, New Jersey.
The Baltimore Orioles play in Camden
Yards.
These were famous people, famous cases.
But they were civil tort cases brought by
innocent people against government had
intruded upon them.
So the remedy of the Fourth Amendment
provides as a remedy for innocent people.
If the government messes with you, you sue
them in, in trespass.
The exclusionary rule.
Doesn't have the right remedial fit.
Let's say, for example, the government
beats you up.
Well, obviously you need a remedy.
The exclusionary rule isn't a remedy
because it doesn't find anything.
It just beats you up and strip searches
you.
Once we understand that, that you have to
have remedies for innocent people, which
the framers did, I think we see that the,
the remedy is tort suits.
Now, imagine a tort suit.
Two different people.
The government actually searches two
identical twins, Adam and Bob.
They're identical, both searches are
unreasonable and illegal.
In Adam's house they find nothing.
In Bob's house they find the smoking gun.
He committed the murder, the bloody knife.
He committed the murder.
They introduce it against him, and he goes
to prison for 20 years.
Now which is the Founder's rule.
Let's imagine that Adam and Bob both sue.
Because they, they're rights were violated
by this unreasonable search.
Adam gets let's say $1,000 for the, let's
say $100,000.
$100,000 for the unreasonable search or
seizure.
Bob sues then.
He says, well I have the same privacy
violation.
They did the same search to me.
And they found the knife, and I went to
jail for 20 years.
So I deserve not $100,000, but $20.1
million, because
I went to jail for 20 years, in addition.
We would never give Bob $20.1 million, in
a proper tort.
We say you're in prison for 20 years,
because you're a guilty so-and-so, because
you did it.
You know.
You suffered no more of a privacy
violation than Adam.
The government wrong was intruding in your
house.
Not finding the evidence, not finding the
knife.
That's not the privacy violation.
Introducing the knife is no new Fourth
Amendment violation, you suffered the
same violation as your twin brother Adam,
you get the same remedy, $100,000.
You do not get extra compensation because
you're a guilty so and so.
So the Fourth Amendment Exclusionary rule
does not have the proper remedial fit.
Remedies have to fit the scope of the
right, the right of the Fourth
Amendment is about protecting innocent
people from
being intruded upon in all sorts of ways.
And, and if you're guilty you benefit to
the same extent, but no more
you don't get more rights, because you're
guilty, you don't get zero if you're Bob.
But you don't get $20.1 million either,
you get the same thing that Adam does.
because you suffered the same violation no
more, it was no extra violation
of your rights that we actually found the
knife and introduced it against you.
And in fact if we hadn't found it then,
the the legal
system can also, maybe we would've found
it some other way, and if
we had found it some other way, we should
have been able to
introduce it against you because the truth
should out in a just world.
In a just world, if you did the crime, you
should be convicted.
We want to separate the innocent from the
guilty.
We don't want to convict you if you're
arguably innocent but Exclusionary
rule isn't about innocence, and that's why
it's not a proper remedy.
Okay, so now I think you have a
little bit of sense of implementation and
remedy, interpretation.
Professor, what about this precedent
thing?
You've mentioned it as a component.
And how, what am I supposed to do when the
precedent says one thing and the written
constitution says another?
Well, the Warren court faced that all the
time.
The written Constitution says equal.
Plessey, when it comes to segregation,
Plessey says forget about equal.
You know, we wink at that.
So are you going to follow Plessey which
says we
wink at equal or are you going to follow
equal.
That's what made Brown an interesting case
is precedent was on the
other side, the text said one thing, the
precedent said something else.
Which do you follow, the text or the
precedent?
What does the Constitution say about
precedent?
What does precedent say about the
Constitution?
How can these things be brought into
alignment.
And my suggestion is the Constitution says
a fair amount, not everything but
a fair amount, and I think we can tease
out some relevant principles.
And the Constitution says that it is the
Supreme Law for land.
Not what Presidents say.
Not what Congress does.
Not what courts say.
Supreme court is the supreme over other
courts.
It's not supreme over other branches.
It's not supreme over the document.
It exists under the document.
The Constitution, the Supreme law.
Is above and over the, the Supreme Court.
That's what the Constitution itself says.
And if you always followed precedent, even
if you were sure that it was wrong.
We'd eventually be drifting away from the
supreme law of the land.
It would be like a game of telephone, you
know, the little, the kids' game where
you whisper into someone's ear and she
whispers
into the next person's ear and you go
around.
And by the time you get to
the twelfth person, everything's been
completely garbled.
Well, that's what the world would look
like if
we always followed precedent without
checking every so often
to make sure that the precedent hasn't
drifted way
off course, way away from the court
constitutional principle.
So I think the core idea the Constitution
has it's supreme,
not the Judiciary, nor the Executive, nor
the Legislature for that matter.
So Professor are you saying there's no
rule for precedent at all?
No, I'm not saying that.
I think the Constitution itself recognizes
a certain rule for precedent to limited
role, let me identify three factor, three
important idea precedential components.
One, vertical precedent, thus Supreme
Court;
it's not Supreme or the Constitution, but
it is Supreme over lower courts, lower
courts are inferior to the Supreme court.
That's actually the constitutional use of
the word, inferior
courts, twice in article one section eight
and article three.
So these courts are inferior to the
Supreme court.
So if you are at a lower court your job is
actually not to, to channel the written
Constitution as best you can.
It's basically to pay attention to what
the Supreme court has said and done.
In effect to pay attention to what Anthony
Kennedy thinks, because
he's the fifth Justice on the Supreme
Court on many issues.
And the, and that court is supreme over
you, and if it is an open question,
the Supreme Court hasn't decided anything,
well then
you have to look to the written
Constitution.
But otherwise an inferior court takes its
orders from the Supreme Court.
It's the lieutenant, you know, it's the
captain, it's
the major, it's not the general or the
field marshall.
That's the Supreme Court.
So the Constitution itself gives us a
hierarchy within the Judiciary.
Lower courts have to pay attention to the
Supreme Court's interpretation.
Okay, now you're on the Supreme Court.
Now you're Justice Kennedy, for example.
What are you supposed to do if you take
seriously your Constitutional obligations?
There's an earlier Supreme Court case that
says x.
You think the text of the Constitution,
fairly read, says y.
Which do you go with?
Well, one thing you do is, you might want
to at the very least, make sure,
look again, make sure actually, that that
you,
that that other court take another look at
that court, earlier court decision.
Because those were Justices just like you
who were trying to do their job and, and
you might want to there might be deep
wisdom in what they said on second
thought.
When you look at it again you might say,
you know, I originally thought the
Constitution meant y,
but there's this earlier case that was
decided by
John Marshall and it says x, and it's John
Marshall.
You know, and then I think he may have had
a, you
know, he had a pretty good idea of what
the Constitution meant.
So, the earlier cases, especially ones by
very well-respected
justices or may have let's call it
persuasive authority.
Epistemic, wait they might actually
influence,
what on second thought, you believe is
the best interpretation of the
constitution,
and that's a weight that precedent has.
Precedent is also the starting point.
The Supreme Court does not, like the House
of Representatives die every
two years and just emerge again with a
completely new set of possibly of people.
It changes very gradually.
It's a continuous body.
And the same with the Senate, it is a
continuous body.
And a continuous body by it's very
structure.
This is an argument about the written
Constitution implicitly as a whole.
It's structure suggests, actually, a
certain continuity, so at the very
least you can say I'm going to follow
precedent unless I'm persuaded otherwise.
That's my starting point.
I don't, I'm not going to try to think,
rethink every single thing afresh on, you
know, every case.
I start with the precedents.
They are now, if I'm persuaded that
they're
wrong, I'm going to give them a second
look, because maybe they were right, and
maybe
I was wrong in thinking that they were
wrong.
So, they're my starting point.
They have some persuasive weight,
especially if it comes from
someone like John Marshall or Joseph
Story, some particularly respected Jurist.
They're my starting point, they're my
persuasive weight,
but if at the end of the day
I'm persuaded that the the Constitution
really says
something else, generally, the
Constitution says it's supreme.
Any additional exceptions?
Two more.
One.
The judicial power applies to things that
have already
happened, to transactions that have
already occurred in the world.
It is specific and retrospective, that's
the nature of judicial power.
It acts upon cases and controversies that
have
already arisen, stuff has already happened
in the world.
Now if the people who have acted in the
world were acting in
reliance on earlier precedence, and
organizing their
conduct in relation to this earlier
precedence.
That is an equitable factor that the
judicial power
probably takes in account because it's
designed to be retrospective.
So where it lies, interests are important.
They are built into the nature of judicial
power,
which talks about judges having cases in
law and equities.
It's an equitable consideration that
judges
may permissibly take into account if the
parties have acted in reliance on the
precedent, even if the precedent is wrong.
That might influence who should win
between the
parties, because they reasonably relied on
the precedent.
But, going forward, the court might say
you know what?
Okay, we think we were wrong before, we
can't change
things in a way that, that, that upset
settled expectation, but
we might announce in the, today's case
that we think
we were wrong before because when it comes
to future cases.
Maybe, actually, we're putting people on
notice
that a different rule might be sensible.
We have, there was a wrong committed.
The wrong was our own previous court case,
and
we're supposed to fashion a remedy for
that wrong.
And the remedy might begin by saying we
goofed and in the future
we need to try to think about how that
goof might be corrected.
Maybe the legislature can come in as well.
So, so the first step is not to refuse to
acknowledge that we were wrong.
It's to admit that we were wrong, to say
so.
To say what the law is and then to think
about how a proper court should
function with due attention to reliance
interests of
the parties and a proper remedy going
forth.
For example.
I happen to think paper money is easily
an obviously constitutional issue by the
federal government.
Suppose you thought that was wrong.
Well, even if it's wrong, we've had 100
years in which people have been relying
on these green pieces of paper as legal
tender for all this public and private.
It would be crazy for a court to disregard
the
reliance interest that had arisen thanks
to the earlier case.
And judicial power.
To repeat, permits attention to reliance
interests in the
proper resolution of the deci, of, of, the
dispute.
Second, equitable principle.
The constitution talks about the rights of
the people.
They're not always specified.
They're unenumerated rights of the people.
Suppose a case was wrongly decided at T1.
It announced a right, and the right really
did probably exist at the time, but since
then, since T1, the American people have
really embraced that misinterpretation.
We've come to believe that is our right.
Well if so, maybe today at time T2, we
should affirm that, that precedent, rather
than overturn it.
Even though it was mistaken when issued,
now the American people have embraced it
as
a new right, and the Ninth Amendment says
that they, there can be additional rights.
There can't be less rights than the text
permits, but I'm giving
you a case where the, where actually the
court announced an additional right.
Maybe it was a mistake at the time, but
now the people have embraced
it and the Ninth Amendment itself says
that the people can have new rights.
And they are understanding new rights can
come about in all sorts of ways because
of their lived experiences, because of
social movements,
because of changes in technology, because
they actually.
If you thought Miranda was made up.
Well but maybe you say, well the
American people have embraced Miranda
today and even
if it was wrong at the time, today
actually its an un-enumerated right of the
people.
And even this fellow over here who I'm
going to
tell you a little more about, his name is
William Rehnquist.
Early on he thought Miranda was terrible,
but as
Chief Justice he upheld, actually Miranda
on a theory
that well, maybe it was wrong, but it's
come
to be part of our legal culture, our
fabric.
Said William Rehnquist as Chief Justice,
in a case called Dickerson.
So, if we just always follow the
precedents even when they were wrong, we
would soon drift away from the written
Constitution, and I think that's a big
mistake.
But if we say generally we follow the
written Constitution, but the written
Constitution in itself
allows us to treat precedent as a starting
point because the judicial path, the
courts are continuous.
And as persuasive authority, because
that's
why judges give opinions, they gave
reasons.
Maybe those reasons might persuade.
And, and the written Constitution allows
judges to take
into consideration reliance interest in
deciding disputes between the parties.
Things that have already happened in the
past.
And the written Constitution also tells
judges to
pay attention to unwritten, unenumerated
rights of the people.
And those rights can exist by the
people embracing an earlier constitutional
decision that was
maybe wrong when decided, but is, isn't,
isn't, is, is now come to be embraced.
That understanding of precedent I think,
makes sense
of what the Constitution says about the
Judiciary.
Happily it also makes sense of what
the Judiciary had generally said about the
Constitution.
The precepts I've just offered, I think
actually makes sense
of the case law of the Supreme Court about
case law.
The Supreme Court has talked about the
role of precedent, and
in general it's followed the precepts that
I have laid down.
In one case, a case called Casey, a lot of
cases here, a case called Casey,
involving the question whether the Roe vs
Wade should be reputed or not.
There was an extensive discussion of the
role of precedent.
It was a 1992 case called Casey.
And, and there's a couple of sentences in
Casey where the
court seemed to say something very
expansive about the world of precedent.
But I, in this chapter on precedent, argue
that
Casey should be read a little bit more
modestly.
And when you read Casey with great care,
and you read Casey at long sight.
All sorts of other Judicial opinions that
the court has handed down.
Both before Casey and after Casey, the
principles are actually the ones that I've
articulated.
We go with the written Constitution.
And lower courts are bound, but lower
courts are bound by the Supreme Court.
And in the Supreme Court, precedent counts
as a
starting point as persuasive authority,
where there's been reliance interest.
Or where a new right has actually been
embraced by the people, subsequent to the
judicial opinion.
And thus understood, Casey fits with the
Constitution, and the Constitution
fits with Casey, and both of them fit with
in general what precedent has said.
What precedence says about the
Constitution, fits
with what the Constitution says about
precedent.
What could be better than that?
Let me finally tell you about these two
people here.
This is a fellow named Harry Blackmun.
This is William Rehnquist.
They were both Justices in Roe v Wade.
Blackmun was for the right of abortion.
Rehnquist was opposed to it.
They then later joust, and so he
dissented.
Blackmun wrote the majority opinion in
Roe.
Rehnquist later becomes Chief Justice and
he's hoping to undo Roe.
In a case called Casey, it doesn't happen.
He ends up writing the dissent in Casey as
Chief Justice, and
again, an interesting discussion of the
role of stare decisis in that case.
Now, we haven't talked about Roe very
much.
It's one of the things that we're going to
talk about in later lectures.
We're going to have a whole series
of conversations about women's rights in
the Constitution.
We're going to talk about other landmark
statements that are important of
constitutional principal.
Landmark statements that go beyond cases.
We've been talking about cases a lot and
cases called Casey a lot.
We're going to talk about important things
that presidents have said
over the years and congresses and even
private citizens about the Constitution.
As I've said we're going to talk about
women's
rights we're going to come back to Roe vs
Wade.
So there's still a lot of ground for us to
cover.
Stay tuned.
