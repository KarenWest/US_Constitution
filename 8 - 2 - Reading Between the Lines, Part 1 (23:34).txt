Welcome back.
In this part of the course, we're
transitioning from America's
written constitution, which we've been
studying in extensive detail in the
first series of lectures to America's
unwritten constitution which will be
the focus of the lectures for the
remainder of the course.
And by an unwritten constitution, I don't
mean to suggest something that will
undermine the
written constitution but something that
will go
beyond the written constitution, beneath
it, behind it.
But ultimately will be faithful to the
project of written constitutionalism.
That's the trick of how we might go beyond
the literal words
of the document in order to make deepest
sense of the document.
Remember that the document doesn't tell us
how it should
be interpreted.
It doesn't give a, a comprehensive set of,
of instructions, of rules of
interpretation, rules of construction.
And you might think, okay, well that just
means we're supposed to just read
it as if it's just plain English, under
the, the rules of reading English.
But can that be so?
Remember, I left you with a question at
the end of the last lecture.
The question is who presides at the vice
president's
impeachment trial if the vice president is
impeached?
Now, if we read the Constitution sort of
literally,
just by the rules of English, here's what
we find.
In Article One, Section Three, we have the
sentence the
Senate shall have the sole power to try
all impeachments.
So the Senate is going to be the body that
tries impeachments, okay?
Now the question is who presides over
that trial, because the Senate's going to
be the,
the body that tries all
impeachments including the Vice
President's impeachment.
Who presides over it?
Here's what the text says; again Article
One, Section Three, the vice
president of the United States shall be
the president of the Senate.
So he's the presiding officer.
So if you just read the words literally by
the rules
of English, the vice president would
preside at his own impeachment trial.
Can that be right?
Is that what the Constitution
really means, properly interpreted,
properly construed?
Now it turns out there are a couple of
additional clauses that we have to take
into account.
And indeed one of the biggest ideas of
this chapter,
this first chapter in America's Unwritten
Constitution, is that we
have to read the Constitution as a whole
and there
are often more than one provisions to pay
attention to.
So there are a couple of other provisions
that might be relevant to us.
One provision says that when the vice
president is
absent from the the, the Senate, the
Senate
can, needs to be presided over by a Senate
president pro tem, pro tempore.
Okay, but that doesn't help us so much,
because
in this impeachment trial, arguably the,
the vice president
is there.
He's the defendant.
He's in the dock.
He, he shows up and says, I'm present, I'd
like to preside, please.
So Senate president pro tem, because it's,
that person
gets to preside only when I'm absent, and
I'm here.
Well there is one other provision that,
that, might be in the neighborhood.
Here it is.
These are all from Article One Section
Three.
They are all kind of right next to each
other,
pretty much, in the Constitution.
When the president of the United States is
tried
in an impeachment court, the chief justice
shall preside.
And indeed this picture, which we're
going to talk about
at the end of, of this series of lectures
end of the next lecture is a picture a
picture, a, a picture of, the first
presidential impeachment trial.
The impeachment trial of President Andrew
Johnson.
And the presiding officer is indeed, the
Chief Justice of the United States, Salmon
P.
Chase.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
that picture, at the end, as I always do.
That's what this is But, does that help
us very much in our vice presidential
impeachment scenario?
Not at all, because it doesn't say when
the
vice president is tried the chief justice
shall preside,
but only when the president is tried, does
the chief justice preside over this
impeachment trial.
So the rules, just, if we look at them by,
by kind of the standard English,
say the Senate tries all impeachments, the
vice
president is the presiding officer of the
Senate.
There are two and only two textually
specified, explicit exceptions.
When the vice president is absent, the
Senate president pro tem presides and
for presidential impeachments, the chief
justice presides.
So, just by the rules of English, it looks
as if the vice
president presides at his own impeachment
trial if we read the thing literally.
And my friends I'm going to argue, I do
argue in the book there's a
lot more detail of course in the book, I'm
going to try and summarize it today.
That that can't be right.
And we begin
in trying to tell you that that can't be
right with just a basic intuition.
This is absurd that a man could be could
preside over his
own trial, that a man could be judge in
his own case.
And you might say, well so what if it's
absurd, it says what it says.
Well it says what it says in a legal
culture.
And that legal culture, actually, before
the Constitution
was adopted had certain background rules
of interpretation,
of construction.
And these background rules aren't exactly
the same
as just the ordinary rules of the English
language.
They're legal rules, canons they're
sometimes called.
C-A-N-O-N-S, canons of interpretation,
canons of construction.
The most the
best selling book in the entire American
Revolutionary
period other than the bible was a book by
a man named Blackstone.
He was an English lawyer, British lawyer.
And he wrote a four volume treatise
on basically of the rules of, commentaries
on English law.
And many of these English laws and customs
and practices actually carried over to the
colonies.
And, he begins his book talking about on
law on general,
and tells us about some rules of
interpretation.
And he says, ordinarily, judges are
supposed to
pay attention to the words of the statute
books.
And even if the judge doesn't like what
the statute says, the law is the law.
And if the legislature clearly envisioned
a
certain application, even if the judge
doesn't
like it, the judge has to follow the law
as laid down by the legislature.
That's the basic
principle.
But, Blackstone introduces a
qualification.
He says what I just said is true when
judges are basically confronting the main
object, the central purpose of a statute,
which the legislature clearly had in mind.
But sometimes when it comes to weird,
peripheral applications that
the legislature wasn't thinking about when
they passed the law,
if the literal words of a statue would
result in an
absurd result, a result that no
legislature really thought about and, and
intended and contemplated, judges in these
weird quirky situations are permitted
indeed they are invited to disregard the
literal meaning of the statue.
And, if the literal meaning
leads to an absurd result.
Interesting, but
what's most interesting is Blackstone
actually gives two specific examples.
Here's one that he gives that if the Law
of Bologna says it's a
crime to spill blood In the streets of
Bologna, we don't apply that
law if a surgeon needs to perform some
emergency operation if
some pedestrian falls and, and needs some
emergency medical procedure.
Even though the surgeon has literally
spilled blood on
the streets of, of Bologna, of course the
legislature wasn't
thinking about that when it said it's an
offense, it's
a crime to spill blood in the streets of
Bologna.
Okay, but here's the second one, and
it's so interesting because it is our
hypothetical.
Blackstone says suppose the law says that
all the cases which
arise in the manor dale, a certain sort of
lord's estate.
Shall, all the, the cases that arise
within that
manor shall be tried by the lord of the
manor.
If say, you know, when two of the tenants
in the manor have a, a property dispute or
some other dispute the lord of the manor
will try all cases.
And
Blackstone says, but of course that law
would
not apply if the lord of the manor himself
were a party to the lawsuit because no man
can be a judge in his own case.
That's a first principle.
Blackstone says it would be absurd to read
that statute to apply for lord of the
manor
himself is actually one of the litigant
because no
man can be a judge in his own case.
That's actually the example Blackstone
uses for when it's proper for judges to
deviate from the literal meaning of the
law in order to avoid an absurd result
that the legislature actually didn't have
in mind.
And remember, Blackstone is the leading
authority on the
nature of law and legal interpretation in
revolutionary era America.
And a simple straight forward application
of the absurdity principle.
No, vice president shouldn't preside over
his own trial.
No man should be a judge in his own case.
I can try to show you that in a couple of
other ways.
I could say what's the central idea of the
Constitution.
Well, that it is law.
It is just not just law but the supreme
law of the land.
And even though it doesn't say the words
the rule of
law, that idea is clearly implicit in the
spirit of the document
as a whole.
The Constitution is law and it must there
for partake
of the virtues of the rule of law and here
is the first principle of the rule of law
that
no man can be a judge in his own case.
The Constitution's Preamble talks about
its purposes
and one of the purposes is to establish
justice and it can not be just for a man
to preside in his own trial.
Now if the statue or excuse me in this
case the Constitution
had explicitly said the vice president
shall
preside comma, even in his own impeachment
trial then we'd have conclusive evidence
in the words that actually the, the
supreme lawmakers of
America We the People had focused on this
particular application.
And had said no, we actually think it's
okay
for the vice president to preside at his
own trial.
But the words don't say that.
And in fact no
one was imagining that the vice president
would preside at his own impeachment
trials.
They just weren't thinking about it
particularly prominently.
They were focused on presidential
impeachments,
and a couple of things about that.
and, and, and we can actually tell from
the text itself
that they were focusing more on presidents
than on vice presidents.
The vice president was kind of
an afterthought almost at the Philadelphia
Convention.
The document
says, when you read it, that it provides
for presidential
salary and congressional salary, House
salary, and, and Senate salary.
It doesn't provide explicitly for the vice
president's
salary, but of course it would be silly.
It would be absurd to say, oh we can't pay
the vice president then.
It's just, you say, no it doesn't say that
you can't pay the vice
president, it just doesn't explicitly
provide for
it because they weren't focusing on him.
And they weren't focusing on his
impeachment.
They were focusing, however, on his role
in presidential impeachments.
Let's come back to one of those two
exceptions that we talked about.
Why is it that the chief justice presides
at presidential impeachment trials?
The answer is because who otherwise would
have presided but for that specific
exception?
Well, the ordinary presiding officer is of
course the vice president.
And the framers thought that was wrong.
You shouldn't have vice president
presiding over the president's impeachment
trial.
So, even though the words vice president
don't appear in that clause talking about
a
chief justice presiding over the
president's impeachment trial,
that clause is all about vice presidential
recusal.
The vice president shouldn't preside over
the president's impeachment.
The chief justice should.
Why shouldn't the vice president preside?
Because he would have a stake in it.
Because if the president were convicted
he'd move up and,
and that would give him sort of an
improper bias.
And and remember at the time of the
founding the vice president is
not the president's best buddy, his
running mate, his teammate, his ticket
partner.
He's the guy who came in second in the
presidential contest.
He's the rival of the president.
He's Thomas Jefferson
when John Adams is president.
Remember Thomas Jefferson is vice
president, when the two
men run against each other, ran against
each other.
And if, and if John Adams as president
were to be impeached and
tried in the Senate, it would be wrong for
Thomas Jefferson to preside.
He's the ordinary presiding officer, the
vice president, but he'd have too much of
a stake, a vested interest, too much of a,
of a bias in the thing.
Now you might say, oh, well, they saw the
problem of bias, and they specified that
in presidential impeachments,
the vice president couldn't preside, but
they apparently said,
well, in vice presidential impeachment
trials he could preside.
And that is, that, that's the kind of
argument
that gives legal reasoning a bad name this
argument.
Because the text doesn't say that the the
vice
president shall preside comma even in his
own impeachment trial.
And it was preposterous to think that
even though the vice president must recuse
himself
when he stands to gain an office, the
presidency, he doesn't
have to recuse himself when he stands to
lose his office.
It'd be like saying well, you can't be
tried twice
for a single offense but three times, what
the heck.
You know or four times.
It'd be like saying, well Congress can't
limit free
speech, but the president acting on its
own can.
Sometimes in law, certain things follow.
Here's a Latin phrase,
a fortiori.
Even more strongly.
You have to read not just the words but
the spirit, the principle.
And the principle of the chief justice
clause, the clause that says
the chief justice should preside in
presidential impeachment, is that the vice
president shouldn't because he would have
a conflict of interest and, of course he's
had even more of a conflict of interest
when he himself
is on trial.
You might say, well, why did they then
specify it for presidential impeachments?
Well here's one reason why.
Because strictly, strictly speaking when
the president is tried, the vice
president isn't presiding over his own
case, it's sort of someone else's.
So, so it went without saying that a
person couldn't preside in his own case.
But for someone else's case, the matter is
a little trickier, arguably.
now, you might think, well gee, wouldn't
all
of these problems have been solved if the
framers
had just simply said, as a general
principle, no
man can be a judge in his own case.
And the answer is actually that wouldn't
have solved it too because you still would
have had to decide what does it mean to be
a judge in your own case.
What happens, for example, if you're
presiding over
a trial in which your brother is a
litigant?
Which has happened.
Brockhurst Livingston,
a justice on the Supreme Court, sat on a
trial where
his, his brother, Robert Livingston, had a
steamboat monopoly patent at issue.
Roger Tawnee, Chief Justice of the United
States,
didn't recuse himself when his
brother-in-law a man
named Francis Scott Key, you may have
heard of him, was the lawyer in the case.
In the Dred Scott case Benjamin Curtis
actually dissented and in
the process sided with the lawyer for Dred
Scott,
who happened to be his brother, George
Ticknor Curtis.
So, you have a, a rule saying no man can
be a judge in his own case.
It's not self defining.
So, so we're going to often have to go
back to first
principles even to to understand specific
text, but here's the point.
We have to read the Constitution
holistically and
not literally with attention to its larger
purpose.
It's adopted, actually as, as one
whole instrument.
I'm going to come back to this picture of
presidential
impeachment at the end of the, of my next
lecture.
But just to, to foreshadow a little bit,
sometimes certain conflicts of interest
actually are built into the Constitution,
and
the framers basically signed off on them.
Who is judging Andrew Johnson?
A bunch of senators, a lot of whom are
politicos.
A lot of whom actually might
want to be president themselves.
But that's clearly contemplated by the
Constitution.
The politicians, ambitious politicians,
are
going to be judging other ambitious
politicians.
Who presides?
A chief justice.
I'm actually going to tell you a story
about how Solomon P.
Chase actually, who's the presiding
officer at this trial, himself wants to be
president, wants Andrew Johnson's job at
the very moment he is presiding over that.
But it's still, that's a conflict
of interest that the framers actually did
build into the main
object, the main purpose, of the clauses
that they, that they drafted.
So judges aren't permitted, just anytime
they want,
to disregard the main purpose of a statue.
But when it comes to really weird
applications that no
one was thinking about, and no one was
thinking at
the founding about a vice president
presiding over his own
impeachment trial, then the rule, it's
called the Rule of Absurdity.
It's a canon and
a rule of interpretation, of legal
interpretation, permits
us to deviate from the literal meaning of
a sentence or a clause in order to make
sense of the document as a whole.
Which is about the rule of law, and
establishing justice.
Now that's just one illustration of this
idea of the need to read the Constitution
as a whole.
Let me give you another one from the most
famous, one of
the two or three most famous, cases in all
of American history.
If you ask what are the three big Supreme
Court cases,
I'd say they're Marbury versus Madison,
which is about judicial review.
There's Brown versus Board of Education,
which we're going to talk about.
And there's a case called McCulloch versus
Maryland, in
which John Marshall and his court uphold
the power of
the federal government to have a national
bank.
it's, it's an iconic case, and Marshall in
that case not only upholds
the power of the bank, but he also makes a
lot of legal moves.
He teaches us a lot about the art of
constitutional interpretation.
Now if you ask many a lawyer what's the
basis for the congressional power to
create a bank?
They would say
well, the, you know, if you ask, if you
ask a layperson, the
would say oh, well there must be some bank
clause in the Constitution.
But there is no bank clause in the
Constitution.
The document literally doesn't say
Congress has power to create a bank.
Doesn't say that in so many words.
Lawyers would say oh, Marshall is looking
at another clause,
the necessary and proper clause, but
that's a bad joke.
Because the necessary and proper clause in
its own is not some
free standing power.
It has to be necessary and proper to
something else.
It would be like going into, you know, a
coffee shop
and asking how much a coffee is, and they
say you
know, $1.50, and you say how much are
refills, and say
refills are free, and you say okay, I'll
have a refill.
But you don't get the refill unless you
actually get the, buy for a $1.50.
You don't get the free refill without
buying the original cup of coffee.
And you can't use the necessary and proper
clause
unless it's connected to something else in
the document, and
here's the kick in the head.
Marshall never really tells us what
specific other clause connected
to the necessary and proper clause really
is doing the work.
And in fact, he upholds the power of
Congress to create
a national bank even before he starts
talking about necessary proper clause.
And here is in fact what he says.
It's not a necessary in proper clause.
It's not any other specific clause in the
document.
Marshall says it's the whole thing.
We have
to read the Constitution as a whole in
light of its larger purposes and spirit.
Here is actually what McCulloch says.
Point one, Americans adopted the
Constitution for national security
purposes.
That's what the document as a whole is all
about, just as
I said before it's about the rule of law
and establishing justice.
It's about national security and ordinary
farmers
aren't paying attention to every word.
They're just trying to understand the
document as a whole.
The document can't have detailed
provisions about everything.
It would be too long.
So it has to be short so it could be read
by ordinary people.
We adopted it as a whole.
So we have to read it as a whole.
And as a whole, it's about national
security.
That's step one.
Step two, the national bank is pretty
useful for national security.
To move money around from east to west,
north to south.
You're going to need to borrow money in
war time on behalf of the United States.
as, if the army is in one part of the
country you need to
get men and, you need to get money, to pay
them on-site and on time.
If you've ever had to cash an out-of-state
check, you know what I mean.
It's a kind of ATM argument that in order
for the federal government to
be able to pay soldiers on-site and on
time the National Bank is pretty useful.
So, the Constitution says aye for national
security.
The bank is pretty useful for national
security.
Step three, pretty useful is good enough
for government work, we're at the next
case.
Because not everything Marshall says can
be specified.
This is not a flaw in the document, he
argues.
This is, it's not a bug.
It's a feature, because if you have to
specify everything
no person can be a judge in his own case.
And,
but only if the main object of,
of, of, of the Constitution doesn't
specify otherwise.
And, and we draw the line between
brothers-in-law and brothers.
Or between brothers-in-law and cousins.
And, and, there has to be a bank clause.
If we have to have every single
application specifically identified
in the Constitution, then Marshall said,
ordinary people couldn't understand it.
It would not be understood by the public.
He says, we must never forget it is a
Constitution we are
expounding and he means we have to
understand the document as a whole.
We have to read between the lines.
Okay, those are a couple of examples.
I am going to give you a few more in the
next lecture.
I am going to tell you the second half of
McCulloch versus Maryland,
which is how once Congress has created a
bank, properly, states can't undo it.
And,
then I am going to introduce you to a
hypothetical friend of mine, whose name is
Lincoln Abraham.
And after I introduce you to that friend
we
are going to talk about the real Abraham
Lincoln.
And at the end I'm going to come back to
this picture.
As I always do at the end of chapters.
So, stay tuned.
