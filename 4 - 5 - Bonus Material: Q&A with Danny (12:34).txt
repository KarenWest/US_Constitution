Hi, I'm Danny one of the
TA's from Professor O'mar's Constitutional
Law class.
This week for our interactive segment I'll
be
going over some of the questions that our
on the discussion forums not only from
our,
live question and answer session a couple
weeks ago.
But also from the questions about the
individual
week's lecture materials that you are
posting online.
I know I'm speaking for all the TA's when
I say, we're
really appreciating the, all of the
questions you guys have been asking.
And also
all of the deep and specific conversations
that
have been going on in the discussion
forums.
We are really impressed by the level of
conversations that are going
on, and there are a lot of really
interesting questions out there.
So, having said that, let's move on to the
first question.
That's one from James Raths, who asks,
where in the Constitution does
it say how the size of the House of
Representatives can be changed?
Why isn't the House still limited to 65
members?
And with that, he's alluding to the size
of the House at the time
of the ratification of the Constitution.
So, the size of the House of
Representatives is
a little bit different than the size of
the Senate.
Article one, section two of the
Constitution, specifies
that in clause three, that representatives
shall be,
for the House of Representatives, shall be
apportioned
among the several states according to
their respective numbers.
This is unlike article one, section three,
which gives a
very concrete rule that the Senate of the
United States
shall be composed of two senators from
each state.
So, what you see here is that in article
one, it, the size of the House
of Representatives is going to be changing
over
time, according to how Congress self
should be apportioned.
That means it's not done by constitutional
amendments, or
within the first and original text of the
Constitution, but
rather by statutes that Congress passes,
every so often
to determine how many representatives
there, there will be, and
how they'll be apportioned among the
several states.
Now the Constitution doesn't say any
number is okay.
It puts both a floor and a ceiling on
the number of, of members of The House of
Representatives.
So as a floor, article one, section two,
clause
three, specifies that each state have at
least one representative.
So, as of today, there would have to be at
least 50 representatives, although it's a
little bit odd to conceive of a House
of Representatives that is smaller than
the Senate.
There is no firm constitutional rule that
says the House
of Representatives must be larger then the
Senate, but there
is some clues both historical and textual,
that indicate that
it was designed to be larger of the two
houses.
For instance, article one, section two, in
the first clause, says
that the, in order to vote for members of
the House
of Representatives, electors in each state
shall have the qualifications requisite,
for electors of the most numerous branch,
of the state legislature.
That basically means that structurally,
the
House of Representatives is designed to be
analogous to the more democratically
elected, more
numerous house of the state legislatures
too.
So, the, the floor then is set at one
representative per state.
Although there's a suggestion that it
should always be bigger than the Senate.
Then there's a ceiling, too, saying that
the number of
representatives shall not exceed one for
every 30,000 people in
the United States.
This though, is a pretty big range.
You can see that by just looking at the
size of the United States today.
50 states, around 300 million people, and
that would mean that the size of the House
of Representatives could range from 50
representatives to
around 10,000 representatives, which is a
pretty big margin.
And actually at the time of the founding,
a lot
of people were concerned with exactly
James's question about how,
how congress would apportion the number of
people in
the House of Representatives and what the
number would be.
Would it be more like 65 or would it be
more like thousands of people?
As Professor O'mar himself actually wrote
on
page 78 of America's Constitutional
Biography, no
aspect of the federal Constitution
provoked more
trench and criticism than the House size.
There were a number of debates that
anti-federalists had, where they
were concerned about the small size of the
House of Representatives.
They were concerned that a smaller House
would be more susceptible
to bribery and corruption because it would
be easier to buy
the votes of a smaller number of people,
than it would
be to buy the votes of a larger number of
people.
They were also just democratically
concerned that
there wouldn't be enough opportunity for
political involvement
of people who wanted to run for office if
there were fewer offices to have.
And, there is also a concern
just in terms of representational
democracy that
any one representative that has to
represent
the interest of more and more people would
be less able to represent them well.
And one of the reasons you can, one of
the ways you can see historically, just
the depth to
which this debate happened, is that it
wasn't even
resolved until the very last day of the
Constitutional Convention.
At which point, George Washington himself
intervened.
This is pretty remarkable because George
Washington had been making a habit
of not intervening in substantive debates
during the Constitutional Convention which
he presided over, but rather remaining
neutral on most of the issues.
However, when it came to the size of the
House of Representatives, George
Washington suggested a change in the
maximum
number of representatives allowed, in
order to
make the House potentially bigger, so on
the very last day, they changed
the, the maximum rule from one for every
40,000 people, to one for every
30,000 people.
Now, especially at the time of the
founding when the population of the United
States
was much smaller, this could actually be a
considerable change in the number of
representatives allowed.
What's also remark, remarkable about this
change that George Washington suggested on
the very last day, is that if you look at
the U.S.
Constitution itself in the National
Archives, you can still see the smudge
on the document from where the change was
made from 40,000 to 30,000.
Even with this change though, people still
had concerns.
And during ratification debates all these
concerns
about corruption and political
participation still raged.
And five states, when they ratified the
constitution, specified
with appended documents to their
ratification vote, that they
believe the House of Representatives
should be larger than
just 65 as it was established originally
in the Constitution.
So by 1793,
congress had responded to these requests
or demands, depending on how
you characterize them, and increased the
House size to around 100.
And the House of Representatives kept
increasing with the population
of the United States throughout the 19th
and 20th centuries
and in, until around 1912, when it capped
out at
435, which is the size that it's remained
to this day.
So thanks, James, for that question.
Next up, we've got a question from Norm
who asks, why did
the Supreme Court not rule the
Alien and Sedition Acts unconstitutional
immediately?
Referring to a set of acts passed in the
late 18th Century, right around the first
the first Congresses.
That criminalized certain things that we
would think would be unconstitutional
to be criminalized today, such as
criticism of the, the government.
Now, this is a, a question that has a lot
of layers.
And one of the first important things
to be clear about, is that the Supreme
Court, under our constitution's
structure, does not issue what are
sometimes called advisory opinions, where
a court
can simply take it upon itself to declare
certain things about the
law or certain things about the world,
without parties in front of it.
That's because under article three of the
Constitution, the Supreme Court is
only allowed to rule on cases and
controversies that are brought before it.
So, simply put, even if a law may
be unconstitutional, the Supreme Court
won't declare it that
way, until parties bring the case before
the court.
Now the Alien and Sedition Acts were not
actually
tested in front of the Supreme Court,
although there
were numerous other courts that did
convict people and
there were successful cases brought under
the Sedition Acts.
The other thing to think about, in terms
of judicial
review, which is, courts declaring acts
uncon, acts of congress unconstitutional,
is that it was not as firmly established
at the end of
the 18th century, or beginning of the 19th
century, as it was today.
Today we take it as more of a given that
the Supreme Court can
hold laws unconstitutional, but around the
time
of the founding, that was on shakier
ground.
finally, there's the fact that even if the
Supreme Court were to directly consider
the constitutionality of
the Alien and Sedition Acts at the time
that they were passed, the First Amendment
was not
regularly used to strike down laws that
Congress passed until into the 20th
century.
So, even though we today think of the
First Amendment as a very powerful tool
for courts to use, it took quite some time
for it to get that way.
One of the interesting things that you can
see
with the history of the Alien and Sedition
Acts though,
is the role of other branches beyond the
Supreme
Court, in interpretation of what is and is
not constitutional.
So for instance, Thomas
Jefferson was a vehement critic of the
Alien and Sedition Acts, and when
he was elected in 1800, he pardoned people
who had been prosecuted underneath it.
And he also repaid them, reimbursed them,
for the fines
that they had been charged under the Alien
and Sedition Acts.
He also, as all presidents do had the
non-prosecutorial power, which is a fancy
way of saying, a president can decide not
to prosecute someone under a criminal law.
So if
Congress decides, if Congress passes a law
criminalizing certain behavior, and the
President views it, that criminalization
as
unconstitutional, the president doesn't
need for
the Supreme Court to weigh in on the
matter, because the president
can decide not to bring any charges
against people for violating that law.
Jefferson did this with the Alien and
Sedition Acts.
And ultimately, one of the things that the
Alien and
Sedition Acts also reinforces is the role
of the people.
People like you and me in constitutional
interpretation through the voting bah,
box.
In the election of 1800, the
constitutionality of
the Alien and Sedition Acts was a major
issue.
And Jefferson wrote and spoke about it
regularly.
It was on people's minds.
And you know, in the election of 1800 we
got a new president and a new congress.
And ultimately, the Alien and Sedition
Acts expired, and the new congress did not
make new ones, and the new president
probably would not have signed a new one.
So that's one of the ways you can see in
which, even if the Supreme Court doesn't
hold an act unconstitutional,
Congress, the President, and ultimately
the voters can decide that certain
things are outside of what we want in our
constitutional order.
So that was a great question too.
Finally we've got a question on secret
voting
that is appropriately from an anonymate,
an anonymous commenter.
Anonymous asks, was there ever any
consideration of making
all individual congressional votes secret?
Congressmen, under a secret voting
campaign would vote
with their hearts rather than along strict
party lines.
And what's interesting to see about this
is
that there's actually no constitutional
requirement for public voting.
There's no, nothing in the Constitution
that mandates that
votes in the House or the Senate, not be
secret.
And so it's not just a question of whether
there was a historical consideration of
whether we can make all individual
congressional votes secret,
but rather a question that exists to this
day.
Article one, section five of the
Constitution specifies that
each house may determine the rules of its
proceedings.
In general, the House and the Senate are
allowed to determine the rules by
which they bring things up for vote,
deliberate them, on them, and vote on
them.
Now, there is a specific provision related
to secrecy of ballots, which is that, in
article one,
section five, clause three the yays and
nays of the members
on each house on any question, shall at
the desire
of one fifth of those present, be entered
on the journal.
And in the same clause, the Constitution
specifies that each help, house
shall keep this journal, and shall publish
it from time to time.
So, what this means is, basically, if one
fifth
of the present members of the House of
Representatives decide
that they want a vote to be make
public, the Constitution specifies that it
must be so.
This isn't to say though that all of the
other votes must be public or must be
private.
And like many things in the Constitution,
it's not specified firmly.
But rather given up to the descretion of
the
representatives in Congress and therefore
ultimately of the people.
So Anonymous suggests that maybe there are
reasons we think that secret codes
in Congress would be a good thing, and
that's a
conversation I encourage you to join on
the discussion forums.
But the important thing to see is that, if
it is
a good thing, the person to talk to is
your congressman.
We don't need a congressional amendment,
we would just need the House itself
to change the rules of its proceedings,
and allow secret votes more often.
Thank you and we look forward to more
of these great questions over the coming
weeks.
