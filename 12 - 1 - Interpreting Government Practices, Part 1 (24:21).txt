[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
Throughout this course, we've been talking
about America's
Constitution written and unwritten and
about constitutional law, but.
What exactly is a constitution?
What is constitutional law?
At root one idea at least is that
constitutional law
is about the government is constitute, how
it's arranged how different
entities and organs of government power
operate and and, and work together.
So if you're ever Meet someone from
Britain for example.
Don't say you know, that they don't have a
constitution in Britain.
They'll take offense at that.
They, they do have a constitution it's
just not a written one, the way ours is.
They don't have a single terse text that
puts
in one place the basic ground rules about
how the society is, is to be governed.
But they do have an unwritten
constitution.
A series of customs, traditions,
practices, institutions
that have created and evolved over the
centuries.
Defining basically their system of, of
government.
How government is constituted in Great
Britain.
They have an unwritten constitution, and
so does America.
But the challenge in America is we have no
just unwritten traditions and institutions
and folk ways about how our system works.
We also have the written one [COUGH].
This, this terse text that I keep alluding
to from time to time.
And, and so the, the challenge for us
Americans is to try
to figure out how our unwritten
constitution fits with the written
constitution.
And ,uh, in this lecture and the next one
I'm going to
focus on ,uh, how government power
is generally constituted, how it's
configured.
We've already talked a little bit about
the presidency and, the big
idea is that the presidency its, its
powers, its [COUGH] its structure.
Its constitution if you will, is defined
not merely by what the terse text says,
because it's not
very specific in certain respects, about
the presidency and article two.
So it's not merely defined by what the
terse text
says, but by, how the presidency has,
existed over the centuries.
How it actually has operated beginning
with
the key precedence set by George
Washington
early on.
That that gave more concrete substance and
meaning to, to an otherwise, slightly
open-ended and ambiguous text.
We're going to see that the same thing
that
we saw was true of Washington and the
presidency.
That there's an unwritten set of
traditions that gloss the tourist text,
the
same thing that's true of the presidency
is also true of the rest
of government.
It's true of Congress, it's true of
the judiciary, it's true of administrative
agencies.
In all these cases [COUGH] excuse me.
In all these cases that text is slightly
under specified it
where its clear it controls but there
places where its unclear.
And where its unclear its actually
the practices that gloss it, that, that
fill out its gaps and give it meaning and
so the unwritten constitution and the
written constitution fit together.
The text controls where clear and where
unclear, the
gaps are filled by the unwritten
constitution, by actual practice.
So lets take congress for example.
And I'll give you a bunch of examples
in this lecture and the next one.
Let's take congress, you might think
congress is a body of enumerated powers.
And you might also think that ours is a
system
of strict separation of powers that very
much protects liberty.
That in general you don't go, you, you
can't be basically incarcerated and
and imprisoned, unless both the House and
the Senate have agreed to a federal
criminal law.
And the President has agreed to actually
enforce it.
If he doesn't enforce it basically there's
no one to prosecute you,
and a judge and a jury both agree that,
that you're guilty.
So at least at the federal level, you
might
think that you have all these separations
of powers protections.
The house and the senate have to be on
board, making something a crime.
The President has to agree that it should
be a crime and has to agree to prosecute
it in effect through his his deputies,
the Justice Department, headed by the
Attorney General.
And judges and juries have to agree.
So you might think there's a strict
separation of power system, generally.
At least at the when it comes to
punishment.
And you might think, at the federal level,
and you might think there are some
numerated powers.
But it turns out it's not quite so.
There are occasions
in which the Cong, each House of Congress
can act on it's own as
policeman, prosecutor, judge, juror jury
and jailer all in one.
Without a statue each house of Congress
can conduct for example,
oh oversight hearings and for, and oblige
people to come testify.
And if they don't those persons can, even
if they are private citizens or government
officials.
Can be held in contempt.
Which means that they can actually be
incarcerated,
detained by The House until they answer
the questions.
And even more for certain offenses that
are committed either by
a private person or by a government
official against each House.
Each House claims the authority and has
done
so since the founding, to adjudicate to,
to prosecute that.
To charge a person with a crime against
the House like bribery of a House member,
bribery of a Senate member or attempted
bribery,
to charge that person to adjudicate for
itself.
The crime and to, to hold that person in,
in prison, basically, in a dungeon,
in the, the house or senate building
itself.
At least as long as the house and
the senate is respectively in session, and
that's
Kind of mind blowing.
It's a, it's a, an exception to the
general separation of powers idea to the
general idea of enumerated powers because
the
text doesn't say that in so many words.
Doesn't say any of that.
And yet, that's clearly established in our
system.
Now the text can be read to permit this
and if it, if
it couldn't, then we'd have to say this
practice is, is just unconstitutional
in so far as it, it, it breaks with the
terse text.
You can say that inherent, in the power of
the legislature are, are certain, in
oversight and investigation, functions,
the power to, to
summon witnesses and oblige them to
testify truthfully.
And to prosecute certain offenses against
each house.
You could say that's just inherent in,
the, being a legislature.
You can say parliament, the English
parliament have those power.
And many state constitutions had state
legislatures at the time of the founding.
And the time of founding, the state
legislatures claimed these inherent
powers, even when they weren't
specifically mentioned in the state
constitution.
So you could say, well, the time of the
founding parliament could
do this, state legislatures could do this,
but parliament is a sovereign body.
It sort of has, it's not a creature of
enumerated
powers at all.
It can kind of do almost anything it
wants.
It's the proverbial 800-pound gorilla
that,
that basically does whatever it likes.
And state legislatures again many of them
were not creatures of enumerated powers.
And there's a less strict separation of
powers system, at the state level.
For example, certain things might be state
law crimes even though the legislature
didn't
create a statute.
Just judges recognized certain things,
state judges as state crimes.
That's not true at the federal level.
There's no federal crime unless the
legislature makes it a crime.
Federal judges on their own can't create
federal criminal law.
State judges, in effect, can.
So, so if we just had the text of the
Constitution and these, these earlier
examples of state legislatures and
parliament, we
could say well the federal constitution is
stricter.
It's got a stricter system of enumerated
powers.
It's got a stricter system of separation
of
powers so, so congress doesn't have these
inherent
powers the way state legislatures might or
parliament
might But that's not how it's played out.
From day one, the con, each branch of
Congress has claimed these broad powers.
And these broad powers have been
recognized and
confirmed by the other branches of
government.
So, for example, very early on both the
House and the Senate claimed
the power to hold oversight hearings and
to compel people to testify.
[COUGH] When they thought there was maybe
some problem that needed their attention.
And almost anything that could result in
legislation can be
the subject or, or even could result in a
possible constitutional
amendment, can be the proper subject of a
congressional investigation.
Early on, there were questions about the
financier of the American Revolution,
Robert Morris and whether he had engaged
in financial and propriety.
So he actually asked Congress to hold,
hearings on that.
And, and the House of Representatives did
even
though, again, there's nothing specific
that gives it
the power to hold hearings.
When there was a botched military
expedition early
on, under President Washington, by General
Arthur St. Clair.
The Senate held oversight hearings.
And again this was accepted as their
power, they could,
they could subpoena witnesses, and force
folks to, to testify.
and, and if people didn't testify, they
could be held in contempt.
Held to incarcerated,
literally held until they were ready to
answer.
And, more than that early on there was a
fellow named Robert Randall.
And he wasn't a witness before Congress.
He was just accused of having, bribed a
Congress member, early on.
And, so when this allegation came to the
attention of the House
of Representatives that this fellow
Randall
had attempted to bribe House members.
They basically grabbed,
they used their officers, their sergeant
at arms to grab Randall.
Bring him into the House of
Representatives.
They held a trial.
I think it lasted three days.
At the end of the trial they, sitting as
in effect a court.
They just turned themselves into a court.
They, they prosecuted, they, they grabbed
him, they're, kind of, as a policeman.
They prosecuted him on their own, the
House, the House of Representatives.
They sat as judge and jury and in effect
convicted him.
And then they threw him in the, the
dungeon.
There actually are prison cells in the
Capitol
Building, and they held him there for a
week.
And they've claimed the, power, the
inherent power.
To, to punish for certain contempts of, of
congress each house has claimed that power
the supreme court has unanimously upheld
a this a case called Anderson against Done
going all the way back.
To the Marshall Court Era.
Twentieth century courts have repeatedly
reaffirmed this power.
Courts might think that the person is
innocent but they don't release the person
just
if, if the, the House prisoner claims he's
innocent and the, and the court agrees.
They basically say as long as the House or
the Senate acted within its jurisdiction
we're not going to second-guess
the judgments.
So what, what are, what are the rules.
Well, they can, no one can be held for
longer than the house or the senate is in
session.
It has to be for of a violation of some,
of you have to be part,
charged with some crime against congress
itself, like, like bribing a house member.
Or lying before congress, something like
that.
It can't,
the, the prosecution can't violate the
bill of rights.
So you can't be punished for merely
speaking out against congress.
Presumably you're entitled to certain fair
procedures.
To have a lawyer present and other things.
But as long as each house basically kind
of acted as a court and acted only within
the area that that involved
that the jurisdiction of the house or the
senate as such.
Then you can, you can do it.
And again, the text doesn't say so but our
practices do and the text is somewhat
ambiguous on this.
This is understood as an inherent power of
the legislature.
The legislature can't perform its function
unless it can find
out what's happening in the world in order
to legislate intelligently.
So that means
it has that very broad oversight power,
the power to summon
witnesses and get them to, to give
congress information it needs.
And it has to have the power apparently,
on
its own to prosecute the crimes and
offenses against it.
It shouldn't have to rely the thought is,
on
courts or on the executive branch to do
this.
So,
America's written, unwritten constitution
cohere in a way.
The written constitution can be read
different ways and, and these early
practices definitively determine which way
the
text actually, the ambiguous text is read.
Let's talk about vacancies in the three
branches of government.
So what happens for example, if there's a
judicial vacancy?
Well, the Constitution says that the
President
has power to fill certain vacancies that
occur during, let's
imagine a vacancy occurs when the Senate
isn't in session.
because ordinarily, the President would
nominate a
judge and then the Senate would confirm,
the position, but what happens if the
vacancy occurs when the Senate isn't in
session?
It's a cabinet vacancy or a judicial
vacancy.
Well, for a cabinet vacancy you can say,
well.
The president needs his team in place.
He gets to put someone in temporarily.
And there's a specific clause.
The recess appointment clause that says
that the president during a senate
recess can temporarily put someone in if
the senate isn't in session.
But if we were just look, just looking at
the text, when it comes to judges,
that would be a little awkward because on
the one hand there's this recess
appointment clause.
On the other hand judges's are suppose to
serve for good behavior, and affect have,
have life
tenure and have a certain kind of
independence.
And they wouldn't really have complete
independence if
they were basically, only provisional or
probationary judges.
They, they would be in power until the
senate reconvened But then
the senate would be free to not confirm
them for the position.
And to, in effect, toss them out.
And the Senate might do that, because
the Senate was displeased by their early
rulings.
So, so, it's, it's slightly awkward to
allow these
recess appointments for, for judges.
Because that, that doesn't really fit so
well with the idea of judicial
independence.
And if we just have the text in front of
us, we might say, okay.
Well, there's the recess appointment
clause,
and there's the idea of judicial
independence.
We can have them both under the following
practice, that if the president
picks someone to fill a temporary to fill
a, a recess, a vacancy
to fill a vacancy, excuse me, that's
occurred during a Senate recess.
The person should serve just during that
recess.
They shouldn't really be eligible to fill
the slot permanently.
And that way if, let's say there's some
very, senior
statesman or something, and, and so they,
they filled in.
The cases get decided.
We've got the judges in place, but they're
not really kind of up for the permanent
position.
So they have, in effect, complete
independence.
They because that's, they're not going to
have to worry about whether they're
going to
get confirmed by the Senate or not,
because they're not even up for that.
They're not looking, deciding cases,
looking over their shoulder at all
time, worrying about what the, how the
Senate will think about that.
So that's probably the best interpretation
of the Constitution on the
clean slate but that's actually not the
rules of the game today.
And that's because
the Constitution can be read in other
ways, and in fact it has been read
in other ways, and from the beginning,
from George Washington on.
Presidents have picked judges, and put
them on lower courts.
And actually until recently, on the
Supreme
Court, temporarily while the Senate was in
session.
And these people actually, these these
judges decided cases
before they had been confirmed by the
Senate.
And the Senate was free to either confirm
them or not.
And actually in one case, the sen, early
on, the Senate didn't confirm the recess
appointment.
So it was clear early on that, that these
probationary
judges didn't quite have the, the full
independence of other judges.
But never the less, our system has a, in
its actual operation,
in its practice, in its kind of British
style constitutional configuration.
Our system has basically recognized the
legitimacy, the lawfulness of these recess
appointments.
To the judiciary.
Now what happens when, there's a vacancy
in the Senate, that's a little easier.
You hold a new election for the senator,
and before
that election the governor can temporarily
name someone if, if authorized.
So, but what about, so vacancies
for the, the Senate is not so complicated.
But what about the House?
And in particular, what about the very
first
meeting of a, a new House of
Representatives?
because the House of Representatives in
effect, dies every two years.
The Senate is a kind of, ongoing,
continuous body.
At any given election only a 3rd of the
Senate, basically, is up for election,
2 3rds just carries over.
It's a staggered system.
So everyone serves a six years term, but
only 1 3rd
of the Senator's are up in any given two
year interval.
And so the Senate basically, they're
always in effect, or typically, 2 3rd's
of the Senators in place To swear in the
new Senators who've been newly elected.
So that works pretty smoothly.
But what about
the House of Representatives?
There's a two year term.
At the end of every two years the old
house dies and a new house is elected.
These formerly on day one, no one is a
house member before anyone else is a house
member.
No one carries over, there is no
continuity.
Even someone who's has been speaker of the
house for twenty years.
On day one of the new congress, that
person
is just the same as a newly elected
freshman
house member and the interesting question
is.
Well, what happens if there's a question,
about whether someone
was properly elected or not, whether the
election was fair,
remember each house is the judge of its
own elections,
but what happens if there's a question
about some house member?
Well, if there's one or two or three
contested elections, everyone else
is sworn in and those people sort of stand
aside, and that.
But what happens if there's a
chal, so ordinarily this question of what
happens on day
one in the House of Representatives is a
little bit theoretical.
But during the Civil War it was anything
but theoretical because there was a
question about a whole bunch of members
of, would-be members of the House of
Representatives.
Who came from the states who had purported
to secede.
And in 1865 they show up and say we're
back,
we are ready to be seated in December of
1865, and the others say not so fast.
But on day 1 you see who decides, who gets
sweared in on day 1.
Who decides who decides?
Who decides who decides who decides?
Its an infinite regress problem in theory.
And eh, so, and the Constitution doesn't
quite specify how all that
will work out.
Now you could say, oh here's what should
happen.
The old House of Representatives the
outgoing one should basically sort
of set up a system for adjudicating
questions for the incoming house.
But from a formal point of view, the old
House of Representatives dies.
It's like Cin Cinderella, you know, at, at
midnight, you know, poof, you
know, she the, the, the, the gown turns to
rags and the pumpkin,
you know, the, the coach turns to a
pumpkin, the horse turns to white mice.
So, from a strict, formal point of view,
at the strike of midnight the.
Old House doesn't exist anymore, arguably.
You could say, oh, well the Senate should
oversee this and because they're a
continuous body.
They're sort of like the big sibling of
the House in the same way that
judges help pick jurors the Senate can
kind of oversee the selection of the new
House.
But the text doesn't say that, in so many
words.
You can say oh well the president should
really
do this cause he's on the job 24 7 365.
He's always in office.
That's a structural idea.
So, he should do that.
But do you want the President really
deciding
who is really lawfully in the House or
not?
That seems a little awkward.
So, if you just looked at the
Constitution's
text it's not so clear what should happen.
Should it be the old
house, should it be senate, should it be
the president?
In fact, in the Civil War, what happened
is, actually, foreseeing that this might
happen at
the end of the war, the Congress, during
the middle of the war, actually passed the
statute.
In which the House, the Senate and,
the President all basically came to an
agreement.
And the agreement was On the first day of
a new House, the clerks, the ministerial,
the clerk, the ministerial officer of the
old House would sit in
the chair at the beginning and decide whom
to recognize and not.
And so really, it's that the old House
kind of lingers a
little bit in order to help select its,
predecessors on day one.
But it does so, thanks to a statute, that
all three branches agreed to, the House,
the Senate, and
the Presidency.
This statute, there's nothing explicitly
in the Constitution
that, that, that provides this solution
But it's basically
how our unwritten Constitution, has filled
in, this
very weird and peculiar gap in the written
Constitution.
Which is how does each house of
represenatives at the beginning of a
new congressional term, every 2 years, how
does it boot strap itself into existance?
How does it jump start itself, how does it
get going, how does it give birth to
itself.
And theoretically it is a real problem,
but as
a practical matter it hasn't been because
the branches
during the civil war have come up with a
very clever solution that has been in
place ever since.
It is part of our unwritten Constitution
that
supplements and complements and, and
completes, the written one.
Okay those are a couple of examples.
In the next
lecture I'm going to give you a few more.
We're going to talk about what decision
rule operates within each of
these branches, should it be majority rule
or super majority rule.
In the house, or in the senate, in the
judiciary.
So we'e going to talk about for example,
filibuster reform in the next
session, and I'm also going tell you as I
always do about the picture.
so, can you figure
out who is fellow is, and what he has to
do with what we've been talking about.
I will tell you at the end of the next
lecture.
So stay tuned.
