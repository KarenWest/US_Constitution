Welcome back.
We've been walking through the original
Constitution in textual order.
We've covered the Preamble.
We've covered articles one, two and three.
The Legislative, Executive and Judicial
powers of the United States.
We've talked about article four which
focused on states and
territories on the relationship, the
horizontal relationship among the states.
And the significance of the
territories and the way in which the
Federal government is going to have
important powers over.
The territories to make those territories
eventually republican states
admitted on equal footing with the, the
original 13 rather than com acting
as a permanent colonizer over the west And
how the Federal
government will also have the power to
make sure that individual
states maintain basic standards of, of
Republican government of democracy, a fair
elections.
And free speech in order to protect the
people of each state
from a possibly tyrannical government, a
military coup or, or something like that.
To protect the people of each state
against its own government
if that government sort of fails to
maintain minimum republican standards.
And in so doing, also protect neighboring
states because tyrannical,
monarchical, un-republican regimes are
threats not just
to their own people but to their
neighbors.
That's what.
History has taught us.
Going all the way back to Philip of
Macedon, Alexander's father who threatened
the, the surrounding democratic
regimes in, in Greece And also protect, by
protecting
the republican government of each state
the Federal government
will be able to protect, basically, its
own foundations
because the Federal government sits atop
state building blocks.
State election law defines at least in the
first
instance, Federal election law for the
House of Representatives.
State legislatures are picking Senators at
the founding.
State law is determining the
the selection of elector electors for the
electoral college.
And if states are screwing up basic
electoral functions,
that's going to compromise the fundamental
foundations of the Federal government.
And, and that actually did happen with the
Civil War.
And again, arguably, in the 20th century
when states were allowed for before a
while.
To,
to run shoddy elections and to prevent
people from
voting who had a right to vote and once
again Federal intervention was required
the second reconstruction in
the 1960's building on the first
reconstruction of the 1860's.
So that's what was talked about thus far.
The preamble, how the Constitution is
ordained and established.
Articles one, two and three; legislative,
executive, judicial power.
Article four, states and territories.
[SOUND] We've now made it to the
end of the original Constitution, articles
five, six and seven.
And that's what I'm going to be talking
about today and in the next lecture.
These three concluding articles of the
Constitution are quite short.
Are united by a theme of basically
Constitutional supremacy.
They explain why and how the Constitution
actually takes priority
over other kinds of law.
In fact the, they refer repeatedly as.
Did the preamble to the Constitution,
remember the
preamble talks about how this Constitution
is or to
be ordained and established articles five,
six, and seven
provide further reflection on the nature
of this constitution.
Let's start with article five, it talks
about
how this Constitution is to be amended and
they're
basically under article five, four
amendment
pathways, two different ways an amendment
can be proposed and two different ways an
amendment can be ratified.
It can be proposed and this is in fact how
all the amendments thus far have been
proposed by Congress.
2 3rds of the House, 2 3rds of the Senate.
So a special super-majority vote from
Congress suffices to propose amendment.
The president actually plays no role in,
in
the process I, I partly, I think the idea
is the amendment process is just a
different
kind of process than the enactment of
ordinary legislation.
So, 2 3rds of the House and 2 3rds of the
Senate
suffice to put an amendment out there to
be ratified by the states.
And in order to succeed under the
expressed terms of article five a
three quarters of the state have to ratify
and and they can ratify either
by state legislatures or if Congress so
provides special state conventions.
Can be the ratifying bodies specially left
to
state conventions but again the rule is 3
quarters.
So two different ways an amendment can be
ratified
either by state legislatures or by state
conventions and all
the amendments thus far, except one, the
repeal of prohibition, the
25th amendment, actually the 21st
Amendment,
have been ratified by state legislatures.
So but two different ratifying mechanisms
but 3 4ths of the states.
Each state counted the same as any
other state and two different proposing
mechanisms.
Congress 2 3rds of the House, 2 3rds of
the Senate.
There's another proposing mechanism that's
never been used.
If enough states ask Congress is supposed
to call a proposing convention.
Maybe con the model of the Philadelphia
convention.
To propose amendments to the Constitution
that, again,
presumably would go to the states for, for
ratification.
So two different pathways of proposing a
convention.
A model that has never been used
and a congressional proposal model which
has generated
all of the 27 textual amendments thus far.
And two different ratifying mechanisms.
State legislatures, 3 quarters of them,
all the
amendments except the repeal of
prohibition, the 21st.
And if Congress so provides, it can
instead though provide for state ratifying
conventions.
Special, special ratifying conventions to,
to,
to ratify a proposed Constitutional
amendment.
So, so what to think about article five?
I think,
several things.
One, arguably the rules of amendment
are the most fundamental, most important,
element of the Constitution.
They specify the rules by which everything
else can be changed.
They operate on a, a higher plane if you,
if you will.
Or maybe,
if you want to think of it as a deeper,
a more fundamental level than everything
else in the Constitution.
These are the rules by which almost
everything else in the document can be
modified.
And article five, I think, did a pretty
good job
of it especially when we compare it to its
predecessors.
The Greek regimes that had democracy, even
if they, they had a consti,
democratic Constitution, they often didn't
have good mechanisms for
Constitutional amendment.
The British Constitution
to the extent that it was claimed to just
be inherited from the ancients
had no kind of it's unwritten and no
express provision four amendments now.
Parliamentary, sovereignty as a practical
matter
might mean that par, anything parliament
wants to do.
It can do, but then that raises a
different problem.
Do you really want to allow your ordinary
legislature to modify the rules any time
it wants?
To modify the rules for its own election?
To, for example, end regular elections or
expand its term of office a three-fold?
Or what have you.
Let's think about the Articles
of Confederation.
Its biggest flaw was that as a practical
matter, it was unamendable.
All 13 states had to combine, and because
you could never get all 13 states to
agree on anything, Rhode Island would
always opt
out, or if not Rhode Island, somewhere,
someone else.
Basically, the framers at Philadelphia
were forced
to work outside the Articles of
Confederation framework.
because, Rhode Island refused to even to
show up at Philadelphia.
So, if every state had to be onboard, it
was just a nonstarter.
And so here's actually what the framers of
the Constitution said to their critics.
The critics said.
Listen.
You know, you forgot a Bill of Rights.
The Congress, the House of Representatives
is, is too small.
They're not insufficient protection for a,
for a jury trial.
What about unenumerated rights?
We've got lots of objections to this
thing.
And the framers said, the supporters said,
well maybe you're right.
But here's one thing that we got going for
this plan.
It's fixable.
It has within it provisions for its own
modification.
And the Articles of Confederation as a
practical matter aren't fixable.
So, vote for the Constitution now.
Once we get it up and running, we can
have amendments and, and we can fix the
thing and
we promise.
Save modererate federalist that will work
on you on that.
So, in some ways, that, that, that the
amendability
of the Constitution is one of its biggest
selling points.
Now compare the Constitution to the state
Constitutions, the Federal Constitution.
Some of them didn't have any provisions
for amendments.
And presumably the Constitution
can be amended by the same mechanism by
which it was
ordained and established but that wasn't
so clear at least textually.
Some of the states basically allowed the
legislature to amend by ordinary statute
so
then in what sense is the Constitution
sort of higher and deeper then ordinary
law.
Fundamental.
A law that limits even the legislature,
that stands outside the legislature.
Other states provided for special
legislative votes.
So you needed special legislative
majorities
but only the legislature could amend.
Well, what happens if the people want
a Constitutional amendment that would
limit the legislature?
If the legislature has a monopoly on
amendment, it's just never going to
propose,
maybe, such a, things that it doesn't like
that would limit its own power.
Other states said, well, there can be
amendments, and they can occur outside the
legislature,
but only at certain specified dates.
Well, what happens if you want to need to
make an important change outside of those
states?
And indeed, in ratifying the U.S
Constitution, a bunch
of states in effect were modifying their
state Constitutions.
And they were doing so outside the
framework of their member
provisions, outside the date clauses, for
example, of, of their amendment
provisions.
So, none of the states really had a some
states provided
for a special convention mechanism for
Constitutional amendment outside the
legislature but didn't
have enough details on how that convention
was going to be was going to operate.
So judged against the baseline of Greece
and the British Constitution and the
Articles of Confederation and the 13
state Constitutions the, the, the U.S
Constitution's
article five is, is fairly impressive.
It doesn't, it has some flaws.
It doesn't quite say how that proposing
convention which we've never
had, is going to work and that's a big can
of worms.
For example, how is it going to be
apportioned?
On the model of Philadelphia, one state,
one vote.
Or on the model of the House of
Representatives, a sort of proportional.
Who is go, going to decide what voting
rule, not just a proportionate rule, but
voting rule that
convention adopts as it's simple majority,
2 3rds something in between.
You know, how are the delegates to that
convention going to be picked?
Will Congress lay down the rules?
Will the state legislatures lay down the
rules?
So article five is not a model
of precision and clarity and, and but
compared
to its predecessors it's not, not a bad
first cut.
Critics have said article five is too, it
sets the bar of
amendments too high but early on in, in
the founders
own lifetime, Thomas Jefferson's lifetime
John
Adams James Madison and so on.
We get 12 early amendments actually
ten amendments that we call the Bill of
Rights, and then the 11th and 12th early
on.
So, so these people who gave us the
Constitution
were able to amend, the thing to their
satisfaction.
And when I was a young person, I used to
say, gee the Constitution is sort of too
hard to amend.
Things could be a lot better and no
whether stop because, 2 3rds, 2 3rds, 3
quarters
is very high, now that I'm a little older,
I think, yeah it could be much better but,
you know what, it could be much worse.
And here's one interesting thing about
article five,
it's set the bar high enough that most
of the bad amendment proposals have
actually fallen
by the wayside, they haven't clear the
bar.
Maybe it's screened out a few good
amendments, but
it's also filtered out a lot of bad ones.
Almost every amendment has actually made
amends.
Made the system better.
And we're going to see that in the later
lectures.
A Bill of
Rights, the reconstruction amendments, the
progressive
era amendments, the amendments from the
1960's.
So a lot of amendments that have improved
the system.
Almost none that have made it worse.
Maybe prohibition, but that gets appealed
soon enough.
The 21st Amendment so, so the amendment
mechanism really did work.
Yeah, it worked enough to, it was supple
to enough
to add prohibition and then to get rid of
it.
So, so I think actually article five is
not
as bad probably as I thought as a young
man.
One of the biggest questions about article
five is, is it the only mechanism of
Constitutional amendment or could the
people of ,of, 2121,
Adopt an entirely new Constitution outside
article five in the
same way that we adopted the Constitution
itself, outside the Articles of the
Confederation or something.
That's a interesting theoretical question
not
a big practical one, today, perhaps, but,
but, who knows, in, in your lifetime, it
may be that as you will.
Will resurface.
Now before we move away from article five,
one other
set of wrinkles about article five I
wanted to, to highlight.
It says that there's, it has a clause
saying, provided that.
So ordinarily
2 3rds of the House, 2 3rds of the Senate
and 3 quarters of the states can create an
amendment.
And the president doesn't have to be
involved and the states can act
again either by ordinary legislative
ratification of
Congress so provides or by special
convention.
And then there's this other mechanism
that's never been used.
States asking Congress for special
convention that gets summoned.
By the way, another question is, could
Congress cause such a special convention
on its own motion?
Let's say, if a majority of Americans
from across the country petition for some
Philadelphia
two convention, could Congress provide for
that even if the states didn't ask for it.
so, so we we've got article five but it
has one other clause that I want to
highlight.
Because remember, you arguably this is the
most important part
of the Constitution, determining how
everything else might be modified.
Article five says, provided that you know
is
it the order rules provided that and a
one.
That the, the rules for importing slaves
wont
be changes until the 1808 clause won't be
changed.
So, so we're not going to according to
article five we don't want an amendment.
That says, you can start prohibiting the
importation of slaves in
1800 or 1795 or whatever.
That's a moot issue today because we're
past 1808 and we've gotten rid of.
Not just the inter, the international
importation of slaves.
The, the the slave trade the Atlantic
slave trade.
We've gotten rid of slavery itself.
So that provision, and that's the 13th
amendment that
we'll talk about in great detail in later
lectures.
So that's kind of a moot point.
But the other provision of article five
says, no state can be
deprived its equal weight in the Senate
without its own consent.
So, you might think as a practical matter
if
we wanted to change the Senate, if we
wanted
to have an, a proportional upper House as
well
as a propor, a proportional by population
lower House.
If we wanted our Senate.
U.S Senate to look like state Senates,
which are proportional.
They're not malapportioned, it's not one
county,
one vote in, in state upper Houses today.
If we wanted to change the Senate you
might think
as a practical matter we'd need every
state to sign on,
because no state can be deprived under
this provi, proviso
of its equal weight in the Senate without
its own consent.
So, you might think 2 3rds of the House
and
2 3rds of the Senate, and 3 quarters the
states.
When sufficed, I think you'd be wrong
about that.
Because this provision, this proviso that
got added on
the last day, and everyone wanted to go
home.
Or, the last week.
And, and, it wasn't thought through very
carefully.
It was not part of.
The great compromise which took many weeks
at the Philadelphia Convention between an
a
proportional House and state's counting
equally whether
they are populous or not in the Senate,
that's the great compromise, that was a
big deal in Philadelphia.
Lots of discussion.
This, this article five proviso sort of
cementing that compromise into article
five itself a special rule was kind of
added on at the end.
They didn't think it through very
carefully and so here's the point fine.
We won't amend the Senate's apportionment
by 2 3rds,
2 3rds, 3 quarters, we can't do that but
here's
what we can do.
We can create a, we can take the power
from the
existing Senate and give it to a new body
call it
a new upper House, call it the Shmenate if
you will,
and that can have almost all the powers of
the existing Senate.
And we can create that by a
simple Constitutional amendment that would
go through
the ordinary article five rules, 2 3rds, 2
3rds, 3 quarters because the proviso only
kicks in if we're modifying the
apportionate rules of the Senate itself
not
if we're taking power from the Senate and
giving it to another body.
Or at least, I think that's the best
reading of the Constitution.
Note though, that small states are still
going to have a lot of protection in that
system because even an ordinary amendment
has to pass the Senate by 2 3rds vote.
And in the existing Senate, each state
counts equally whether it's populous or
not.
Even in the ordinary rules of article
five, 3 quarters of
the states are going to have to say yes
and each state
is going to count equally in that process,
whether it's Wyoming, which,
not very many people, California, 70 times
as large in population.
So, the small states are protected by the
ordinary
rules of article five to a very
considerable degree.
Now,
later in the semester we'll talk about
whether it was even imaginable in
the future that we might have a different
kind of, of, of Senate.
So that takes us to the end of article
five and.
You might ask, okay well what's left.
We've now talked about how the
Constitution's ordained and established in
the preamble.
Legislative, executive, judicial power.
Articles one, two and three.
We've talked about Federalism.
The relationship among the states and we
talked
about the status of the territories,
article four.
We've talked about the rules of
Constitutional amendment.
What's left?
Two things are left.
Article six and article seven.
That's what we're going to talk
about in the next lecture, so stay tuned.
