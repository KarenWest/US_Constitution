Welcome back.
In our previous sessions, we've been
talking about the Preamble of the
Constitution, its first sentence, and
Article
One, the Congressional powers and
Congressional structure.
We're now going to be transitioning into
the next article
of the Constitution, Article Two, all
about the Presidency.
We'll, we'll talk about the structure of
the
Presidency, and also then talk about
specific Presidential powers.
We're going to talk about words.
The very word, "the President", for
example,
but we're also going to talk about
numbers.
The number one.
There's one President.
We'll talk about the number four.
He serves for four years.
The number 35.
The age at which one becomes eligible for
the Presidency.
We'll, we'll talk about the number of
electors, how the Electoral College was
actually, designed.
And why it was designed.
How it was apportioned.
So let's begin.
And eventually we're going to talk a lot
about this
picture, which is a, a painting of the
Washington family,
a very famous painting, which will
actually, I think, sum
up a lot of the features of the founder's
Presidency.
If you actually understand this picture,
you
understand a lot about the early
Presidency.
Let's begin with the very, word
"President".
Now under the Articles of Confederation,
there was a presiding officer, a
President,
but he looked nothing like the Presidency,
like the President under the Constitution.
That, that presiding officer in the
Articles
of Confederation was basically just a
fellow
who held a gavel in the, the Congress, who
sort of was picked by members
of Congress and who rotated, out of, of
that office, quite, frequently.
That person had no independent, national
mandate, independent of
Congress.
Had no, veto pen, no pardon pen.
No power of appointment.
No direct superintendence of an executive
branch of government.
No commander-in-chief power.
No explicit authority to receive
ambassadors.
No implied authority to negotiate treaties
and conduct foreign policy.
No, immunity from, no fixed term of
office.
No immunity from being instructed or even
re-,
recalled by his, state's delegation, by
his state legislature.
so,
no, no nation-, no guaranteed national
salary.
A very short term of office,
very different from four years,
perpetually re-eligible.
No entitlement in-, indeed, to serve,
again
and again and again without, mandatory
rotation.
So, that President under the Articles of
Confederation was just
the, the, the faintest shadow of the
Presidency under the Constitution.
So, so one question is, why did they call
the person President, then?
And I think one idea may have been to
slightly ease the transition, from, the
Articles of Confederation.
To try to persuade, Americans that this
new system wasn't a total break with
everything that they had come to, expect
under the Articles of Confederation.
Remember that, in Article One,
the, the Constitution calls the first
branch Congress.
Just as under the Articles of
Confederation, there's a thing called
Congress.
But recall that the new Congress is really
different than the old Congress, as we
talked about.
It's a real legislature.
It's bicameral.
It's going to be able to pass laws, it's,
one branch
is going to be directly, repre-, elected
by, by ordinary people.
A very, very different kind
of body.
Even the Senate, which is the part of the
new Congress that looks most like the old
Congress.
Insofar as the Senate is picked by state
legislatures
originally, as were Congressman of the
Articles of Confederation.
Each state is represented equally in the
Senate
as was true under the Articles of
Confederation.
So in those two respects, the Senate looks
a little like the old, the new Senate
looks a little like the old Congress, but
even the new Senate, recall, is
fundamentally different in
that, Senators are going to be voting as
individuals, per capita, rather than as a
state block.
They're going to serve for six-year terms
rather than for one-year terms.
They are going to be immune from,
from state recall and mandatory in,
instruction.
They're going to be paid by the national
government.
They're going to be perpetually
re-eligible, whereas under the Articles of
Fed, Confederation, there
were sort of mandatory term limits for
these, ambassador-like, congressmen,
who, who basically voted as a bloc, as a
delegation,
and a thing that looked a lot like the UN.
So the Senate, the new Senate looks a
little like
the old Congress and yet even there we see
profound differences.
Now, with the Presidency, a new President
looks almost
nothing like the old presiding officer
under the Articles of Confederation.
So one idea, though, was still we'll use
these old labels and that will make this
new office, perhaps, go down a little
easier with, with ordinary citizens.
And here's a second reason.
I think the Framers understood that
the first president would be George
Washington.
We'll talk
a lot about why that's so.
In fact, over the course of these
lectures,
George Washington will emerge again and
again and again
as someone whom, whom we need to
understand in,
in a deep way to understand our, our
Constitution.
Recall that, at the Philadelphia
convention that drafted
the Constitution, Washington was actually
the presiding
officer of that convention and there he
really was a
little bit like the presiding officer
under the Articles of Confederation.
He held a gavel, but he didn't have all
sorts of vast powers, at least
formal powers at Philadelphia, he had a
lot
of informal sway because everyone, so
respected him.
And, indeed, everyone at Philadelphia and
throughout the country knew that,
Washington, if Virginia ratifies the
constitution, will be
the first, chief executive of the United
States.
He, he towers head and shoulder above
everyone else and, in some ways, they
designed, the Philadelphia Framers did,
the Presidency for George Washington.
And, in this way, I think, it was perhaps
apt that, they decided to call
this new chief executive President
because, of course, that was
the label that George Washington had at
the Philadelphia convention.
He was the presiding officer.
The "president" at Philadelphia.
He was referred to at Philadelphia as
"Mister President".
And so I think maybe one idea is just they
became
so comfortable with the idea of calling
George Washington "Mister President",
in Philadelphia, that they, used that
explicit label for the new office,
the chief executive position under the
Constitution that they designed for George
Washington.
Now, one other related difference between
the presiding officer under
the Constitution and the presiding officer
under the Article of Confederation is
the presiding officer, under the Articles
of Confederation, the President,
if you will, basically was there when
Congress was in session.
The Congress wasn't always in session.
It didn't always have a quorum.
The new President is going to be President
of
the United States, not merely President of
Congress.
And the United States as an entity, as an
ongoing entity, is always in session.
So I began
by saying we're going to be talking about
some numbers.
A key number is the number one.
There was one and only one president at
any time.
That's not true of Congress, which is a
multi-member body.
Two houses, each house, actually needed to
be big enough to be
genuinel,y representative of, to enjoy the
confidence of the citizenry.
The judiciary's a multi-member body.
The Presidency is singular and unique.
It revolves around one person and let me
give you a couple of other numbers.
One person, 24,seven, 365, one
person always there.
Congress will go in and out of session.
Courts will go in and out of session.
But America is always in session.
Always needs a presiding officer
at the helm.
That person is the President.
And there may be emergencies that arise,
crises...
Foreign invasions, foreign policy crises,
hurricanes, and the like.
And those opportunities,
maybe land will become, available, in the
west if Napoleon is,
suddenly interested maybe in selling, the
entire Louisiana, territory to the United
States.
There are going to be unique challenges
and opportunities that may
arise, and when they arise, Congress might
not be in session,.
Court, the Supreme Court might not be in
session.
They, they, they take summer breaks, but
the Presidency will always be in session.
He's the President of the United States.
And, and one important
way, then, to think about this office is
what sorts of things
need to get done to preserve the United
States as an ongoing enterprise.
and, and when you ask yourself that
question, you can begin to see how
presidents
may sometimes at, at least temporarily,
need to
do things to keep the United States
afloat.
To respond to challenge, challenges or
opportunities,
until the Congress can be brought back
into session.
So one president.
24, seven, 365, all this at the helm, all
this, in session
because America is always in session.
Okay, so I've talked about some numbers.
The number one, 24, seven, 365.
Let's talk now
about the number four.
The Presidency is a four-year
term of office.
And at the founding, perpetually
re-eligible.
You can be elected again and again and
again.
And you might say, "well, what's the big
deal"?
Today you look out and most governors have
four-year terms, but that wasn't true at
the founding.
Modern governorships, and I'm going to
come
back to this, have actually emerged as,
imitations to some extent.
Echoes of the modern Presidency.
When the Constitution was drafted, no
chief executive, no governor, no
president.
Some of the states called their
chief executives "governors", some called
them "presidents".
The ones who called their chief executives
"presidents",
by the way, had particularly weak
presiding officers.
"Governors", as a rule, were stronger than
"presidents" in the various states,
but no state gave its chief executive a
four-year term.
And the state with the most powerful
governorship, which is probably
Massachusetts, that's the one
state where the governor had, a veto pen
that he uniquely wielded, it's a one-year
term.
In most states, it's actually a one-year
term of office.
Only New York has a three-year term, and
now the Framers
of the Constitution are proposing to give
a President a four-year term.
And they're creating a vastly more
powerful President than
any state, governorship because now this
President's going to be able to pick his
own advisers rather than be stuck with a,
a, a council picked by the legislature.
The President's going to, in fact, pick
his own cabinet officers.
He's going to have a veto pen, which only
Massachusetts has.
A more powerful pardon pen than in most of
the states.
He's going to be commander-in-chief of the
armed forces.
And he's going to be able to receive
ambassadors, and be head of state.
He's going to have vast powers.
Vastly more powers than any state governor
has,
and now you're giving him a much longer
term of office, than most states.
I believe, I think 10 of the 13 states, I
think, had, had one-year terms.
I have to double check on that, but it's
something like that.
So why, oh, and he's independently elected
of the legislature, too.
in, in most states,
in eight of the 13 states, the legislature
picks the chief executive,
rather than being independently elected.
So, so why would you give him a four-year
term?
And I think there are two stories here.
There's a domestic balance, story.
A kind of checks and balances story.
And there's, a geostrategic story.
An international law, international and
foreign affairs story.
Here's the domestic story.
Remember that the Framers are modeling
their Constitution in some
respects on states, but then they're
tweaking some of the numbers.
Because of geography, we're going to have
a, members of
the House of Representatives elected every
two years and Senators every six years.
because it takes longer to get from the
extremes
of the continent to the national capital,
more travel time.
because it takes a little longer
to bone up on foreign affairs.
To actually learn about, other parts of
the country, other parts of the world.
So you need to give,
federal law makers a little bit more time
in office, because of the learning curve.
so, so if you're going to have, and so in
states, most of the, state legislators are
picked annually.
But members of Congress, House
of Representatives, every two years,
biannually.
Senators every six years.
So a four-year Presidency kind of roughly
counterbalances
two and six.
In states, if you've got a one-year, House
of Representatives, and maybe even
a one-year Senate, well, then maybe you
want a one-year chief executive position.
So there's a kind of balance within the
state that
your executive, office roughly
counterbalances
the legislative term of office.
But because, for geographic reasons in
part, we're going to have a longer term
of office for members of the House and the
Senate, we should have a counterbalancing
longer term of office for the Presidency.
Now there's some
other, that's the kind of, the domestic
balance story.
The idea was we're creating a much more
powerful legislature,
a much more powerful Congress than we had
in the Articles of Confederation.
So to counterbalance that more powerful
Congress, we need
a more powerful executive.
Precisely because this new Congress is
going to have a lot more power, we
have to break up its power with
bicameralism compared to the old Congress.
And counterbalance it with an executive
who going to to be able
to keep it in check, for example, with a
muscular veto pen.
Many of the Framers, led by James Madison
at Philadelphia, thought that
state governments had kind of gone,
spiraled out of control a little bit.
That state legislatures
were too dominant.
Within state governments, they ran
roughshod over rights.
They weren't strongly enough
counterbalanced
by judges and by, state executives.
And so if this new federal government was
going
to avoid the mistakes that some of the
state governments
had made, we needed to break the
legislature up into
two, break the old Congress into two
houses, and counterbalance
it with a stronger executive who has a
longer
term of office, an independent mandate, a
veto pen.
Someone who basically, would resist, the
inclination to, to
vote for stuff that might seem popular in
the moment,
but actually would be contrary to the long
term interests
of the American people, to, considerations
of justice and fairness.
One individual legislator might not care
that much about his reputation.
No one's really going to notice whether he
goes along or not.
But a President, he would care about
history and reputation because he'd
be one person with all eyes on him and so
you want to get that person a little
more, powerful base to resist legislative
encroachments.
So that's the domestic balance story.
The foreign affairs story is this person,
your chief executive, is going to have to
go
up against other heads of state in the
world.
And they're, they serve for life.
They're hereditary.
And so you want some stability in foreign
affairs.
And so you want someone who actually is
going to be
able to look a treaty partner in the eye
and
basically say,"Listen, I'm going to be
able to, I speak for
the American people not just in this, this
month, this year,
but more enduringly".
so, there's the domestic story to
counterbalance
the legislature and a foreign affairs
story.
Both of which argued for a longer term, of
office.
Now here's the interesting thing.
Once the Framers of the Constitution got
the American
people to go for this two, four, six
model.
Two year House, four year presidency, six
year, Senate.
Some of the states actually began to
adjust and began
to move away from annual elections for
lawmakers to biannual.
now, as I said, in, in, I think, 48 of the
50 states,
you have governors who served for, for
four years on the Presidential model.
And that, that gradual shift away from
annual elections to, longer
terms of office begins with the adoption
of the Constitution itself.
And shortly thereafter, states start to
amend their constitutions to create
longer, terms
of office for governors and, and now
longer terms of office for legislators,
too.
It's not just four years, though,
remember?
It's four years perpetually re-eligible.
You can run again and again and again for
life, no term limits.
Now, today, the Constitution's been
amended.
A President can't be elected for
more than two, two terms.
Ten years in total because you could
imagine a half-term.
We'll talk about that in later sessions,
but at the founding, President was
perpetually re-eligible.
and, and in the states, those governors
who were perpetually
re-eligible basically almost always kept
running again and again and again.
And they either died in office or left
office very shortly before their death.
John Hancock,
basically, it's annual in Massachusetts,
he's the
governor of Massachusetts, he runs again
and again.
He steps down very briefly in the
mid-1780s and then
keeps running again and again, and he dies
in office.
And the governor of New Jersey,
Livingston, again and
again and again and then he dies in
office.
And the governor of Connecticut runs again
and again
and again, and steps down a year before
his death.
George Clinton, remember,
in New York, it's a three year term.
I think he serves six terms, almost two
decades.
Steps down briefly and then is elected
even for a seventh term.
He ends up dying in office, not as
governor of
New York, but as Vice President of the
United States.
George Washington sets a different
example, he does not die in office.
He got unanimously elected, every single
elector voted for him.
We're going to talk about the electoral
college in our next session.
He got unanimously re-elected.
He could have been, I think, unanimously
re-re-elected in
1796-97, but he chose to step down.
And, in choosing to step
down, he began a tradition which is
going to later become
constitutionalized in the Constitutional
Amendment of a two-term presidency.
So he sets, a different, example than the
state governors, had.
had, had Washington stayed in office until
his death,
maybe a tradition might have emerged in
which the
Presidency became kind of a lifetime
office as a
practical matter, instead of what it has
now, become.
So the text says four years perpetually
re-eligible, but Washington begins to
establish a different tradition.
Washington, in fact, establishes all sorts
of precedents, therefore.
Not just as our first President, and he
does
all sorts of things that later Presidents
will, will imitate,
but he also set some important precedents
as our first,
he sets important precedents, excuse me,
as our first Ex-president.
He comes to embody the idea of an elder
statesman, who, who's available
for advice, if necessary, but
isn't constantly intervening in, national
affairs.
Allows the successor, basically, to govern
peacefully, hands off power
to someone else, and then fades back into
the farm, goes to the ranch.
and, and, and that model is not as visible
in the
text of the original written Constitution
which, which, as I said,
envisions perpetual re-eligibility.
It's the model, instead, that, that, is,
embodied by, the,
the choices made by, by George Washington.
Most particularly to leave office, even
though he could have been re-elected.
In our next session, we're going to talk a
lot about Washington.
We're going to talk also about, the
electoral college and how it's
apportioned.
We're going to talk about eligibility
rules for the Presidency.
We'll talk about, for example, another
number, 35 years.
And I'm going to end that session, with,
this, this, picture, which
is, from, a chapter of the book, America's
Constitution: a Biography.
We're now into chapter four.
This is the picture that begins chapter
four, and we're going to end our next
session,
with a careful examination of this, of
this painting, which is of the Washington
family.
I'm going to try to persuade you that, if
you understand the early Presidency,
you understand a lot of elements of this
painting.
This painting is going to sum up a lot of
the
great themes of American's Presidency
under
the original Constitutions, so stayed
tuned.
