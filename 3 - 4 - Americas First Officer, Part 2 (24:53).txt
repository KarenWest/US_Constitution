Welcome back.
This lecture continues our conversation
about Article II
of the Constitution, which focuses on
America's presidency.
It corresponds to chapter four of the book
America's Constitution: A Biography, which
is our, our guidebook for this walking
tour through the written Constitution.
In our last session we talked about how
the presidency is vastly
more powerful than anything that had
existed
under the Articles of Confederation at the
federal
level, and frankly, also vastly more
powerful
than anything that existed In the 13
States
most State Governments pick their Chief
Executive by the Legislator but in America
the Presidentcy is going to have an
independent base of power he's not
picked by the Legislator and 10 of the 13
States the Governor has
a 1 year term this President is going to
have a 4 year term.
He's going to be per, most states don't
allow, or many states don't allow,
perpetual re-eligibility.
This president is going to be perpetually
re-eligible.
Only one of the 13 states New York, has a
multi-year term
and perpetual re-eligibility, and so,
that's
a three-year term for their governorship.
The presidency is going to be even more
powerful at four.
Only one of the states, Massachusetts,
Gives the governor, and the governor
alone, a, a veto pin the, the constitution
is going to give the president the
veto pin.
And so it's going to combine, in certain
ways,
the elements of the two strongest state
governorships the.
New York governorship three year term,
perpetual re-eligibility.
The Massachusetts governorship, a pardon,
a veto pen in his own hand.
And it's going to add all sorts of
additional exectuvie
powers to, to this supremely powerful new
office being created.
An office To repeat, vastly more powerful
than any
state governor, yet much more constrained
than an English monarch.
And we’ll talk about those constraints as,
as well.
Let’s talk just a bit about what the rules
are for who can become president.
So let’s start with the property
qualifications.
That's right.
None.
Zero.
That's an important number.
We've been talking about numbers.
Zero are the property qualifications to be
President.
A person can be elected President even if
He's not eligible to be state governor.
And indeed, every state that has a
governorship.
Pennsylvania has a kind of a rotating
executive council.
But every state that has a single person
as governor has considerable property
qualifications for that office.
And of course in England to be the, the
chief executive
you have to, be basically the wealthiest
person in England, the monarchy.
But, zero property qualifications for the
presidency.
A radically democratic vision.
Let's talk about religious qualifications.
In England you need to be the head of the
state, the defender of the faith.
In America, there are no religious
qualifications for the presidency,
and indeed a later provision in the
Constitution say, says.
That,
the, in article six, there will be no
religious tests for any federal office.
This too, it's a dramatic contrast, not
just with the rules in England at the
time, but in the 13 states, only one
state, basically,
has gotten rid of all religous
qualifications, that's Virginia, and
The vast number of, of state
constitutions, religious qualifications,
religious tests, are not just permitted,
they are built into the state constitution
itself in about ten of the states.
So remarkable openness.
To towns.
Now, the people will get to decide whom
they choose, whom they have the most
confidence in, no property qualifications,
no religious qualifications.
Now,
there is that thought, that you have,
that, that rule in
Article Two, that a President must be a
natural born citizen.
Which means that he has to be a citizen on
of the day of his birth.
He could have been born abroad, John
McCain
for example was born in Panama canal zone.
Mitt Romney's father George Romney who ran
for president was born in Mexico,
but they were citizens on the day of their
birth and therefore eligible.
And you may thing well
that's kind of a real restriction on, on
democracy.
But in fact, and, and, and it may
reflect some anti-immigrant sentiment, but
let's remember some things.
First of all Everyone who was already an
American citizen, whether foreign born
or not at the time of the Constitution,
was eligible to be president.
Alexander Hamilton was born outside the
United States,
not born, you know, in effect, a citizen
of
the United States, but he was eligible to
be president.
James Wilson, we talked about him from
Scotland born in Scotland, he's eligibly
present.
Anyone who's proved their loyalty to the
American system,
by being here in the American Revolution,
is eligible.
They grandfather all those folks in and,
and, far from being
anti immigrant, they're very pro
immigrant.
Seven of the 39 people who draft
the Constitution at Philadelphia are
foreign born.
Vast numbers of foreign born people
participate in the
act of ordainment and establishment that
result in the constitution.
A third of the early Supreme Court
justices are foreign born, including James
Wilson,
four of the first six Secretaries of
the Treasury including Alexander Hamilton
and Albert Gallatin
are, are foreign-born.
Roughly a tenth of the first Congress is
foreign-born.
Now remember, if you're a naturalized
American
who comes later to the United States
after being born under some other flag,
you are eligible to be in the House.
And the senate.
And the judiciary.
That's not true in England.
In England, foreign born people are
basically perpetually ineligible to
be a member of House of Commons or House
of
Lords or Privy Council or hold any
important position of honor, trust or
profit.
But America's Constitution is open to a
very broad range of immigrants.
In part for national security reasons we
want folks,
talented people, the Framers did, to come
from abroad
and add their strength to the American
projects, to
add Their skills and their talents, their
their military capacity.
We want
them to come here by western land and and
help us in
the next war, which we hope doesn't happen
that we fear might.
And so, it's a quite actually a
pro-immigration document.
So why this special rule about the
presidency?
And I think the idea was ultimately It was
a democratic idea in part.
They were concerned that a foreign earl or
duke
might come over with a boatload of gold
and
buy a presidential election, because there
weren't campaign finance rules in place.
They associated foreign-born Chiefs of
State with monarchy.
George the First was born outside of
England.
George II was born outside of England.
Neither of them spoke English.
So Americans tend to associate foreign
born
heads of state with monarchy and
aristocracy.
So they were worried Maybe some foreign
aristocrat,
the second or third son of Geoge III or
something like that.
The Bishop of [UNKNOWN] was going to come
over with a huge possie, a
retinue of people, boatload of gold, and
try to buy himself an election.
So they created a specific rule and
grandfathered in all the loyal
Americans...whether foreign born or
American born
who were here during the American
Revolution.
the Alexander Hamilton's of the world.
The James Wilsons of
the world.
So, so we talked about, no property
qualifications.
We talked about no religious
qualifications.
The natural born citizen requirement is
actually
a egalitarian idea, an anti-aristocracy,
anti-monarchy idea.
What about this idea that a president has
to be 35?
Isn't that a restriction on the peoples
ability to choose
the most virtuous person, isn't that
anti-democratic?
Well not quite.
Because the spirit there was actually
pro-egalitarian.
Who could get themselves elected president
at the age of 33?
What kind of person would have the name
recognition to do that.
Now note that they are not thinking about
any specific indivudual.
This wasn't.
An effort to try to keep Alexander
Hamilton out of the presidency immediately
cause he's only 33.
Everyone understands to repeat that George
Washington is
going to be our first president if
Virginia says yes.
And he's going to continue to be president
as long as he's willing to serve.
So, it's not trying to exclude who's
currently
31 or 32 when the Constitution is being
considered.
But there is a concern, more generally,
about a certain kind
of person that famous son of a famous
father.
That's the kind of person who could get
himself
elected president, and possibly at the age
of a 30,
or 32, or 33, Who is the Prime Minister of
England that they're coming up with this
rule, these rules?
The answer is, William Pitt the younger.
Whose daddy was Prime Minister, William
Pitt the elder.
And the congress likes
his daddy, Pittsburg is named after
William Pitt the elder, but
William Pitt the younger becomes a member
of parliament at age 21.
Prime Minister at age 24.
He might be good, he might be bad,
but he's getting it because of his daddy's
name.
The American Constitution is trying to
prevent that.
Before you can get elected president, you
should
actually have a tract record of your own.
So at 35 we'll know you are.
You can have held other offices, you could
have been in
the House or the Senate or State
Government or something else.
You'll have a chance to show your stuff
and be judged by your own merits.
It's an anti-dynastic idea.
And indeed, George Washington is picked as
first president in important respects for
anti-dynastic reasons.
George Washington becomes father of his
country.
Because he's
not father of his own children.
And this is very well known.
Mr. Washington himself says in a, in a
early version of his
first inaugural address in early draft and
he cut this out because.
He was advised by Madison that it was a
little too personal.
Here's what George Washington writes in,
in effect and what he's saying well,
let me actually first read you the quote,
and then I'll sort of translate.
"Divine providence, the good Lord, has
seen, has not
seen fit, That my blood", this is
Washington speaking,
"should be transmitted or my name
perpetuated by the
endearing, though sometimes seducing
channel, of a immediate offspring.
I have no child for whom I could wish to
make a provision.
No family to build in greatness on the
country's ruins No
earthly consideration beyond the hope of
rendering some little service to
our parent country could have persuaded me
to accept this appointment."
That's what he says in his first draft of
his first inaugural address.
In other words, trust me I'm not going to
try to create a throne
because I've got no one to give it to
there is no George the Second.
To give power to.
And indeed of the early presidents, you
see.
Thomas Jefferson, George Washington has no
sons.
Thomas Jefferson has no sons, at least
legitimate
ones that we know about who bear his name.
And, little Tommy, James Madison, has no
sons.
James Monroe has no sons.
Now John Adams you see, has a son.
And his name is Q, as in W.
And his son does become president, but
only
well after he's 35 years old, he has a
track record of his own, John Quincy Adams
does.
Distinguished scholar, diplomat, senator,
secretary of state.
When John Adams leaves office, little
Johnny Q is not even
old enough yet to, to be eligible in his
own right.
I'll tell you one other, a couple of other
sort of, stories.
About their, their obsession, their
concern with dynasty.
Remember, these guys who framed the
Constitution are, were born American
colonists.
They were breaking away from England.
In England, power descends, is transmitted
dynastically you know, from
father to son or father to daughter, Henry
VIII to Elizabeth.
and, and they're trying to break with
that.
They've seen how even in the House of
Commons so
called, power is transmitting dynastically
from William Pitt the elder
to William Pitt the younger, and they're
trying to.
To, to break with that and they pick
Washington
in part because he is a break with dyna-,
dynasty.
You can trust him because he's got no son
to give a throne to.
In the election between Thomas Jefferson
and, and John Adams.
Why, why is, do people think, oh
Jefferson's the Democrat?
John Adams is a monarchist?
John Adams is a farmer's son.
Thomas Jefferson sits on a mountaintop,
lording over hundreds
of slaves and yet he's the man of the
people?
Why is that?
Well, Jefferson is actually very good at,
at
political public relations but, but here's
another thing.
I'll read you actually from campaign
literature in the 1796 election.
Here's a Boston newspaper.
It warns that Adams, if elected, would
work to install his wellborn
sons as lords of this country.
Jefferson, with daughters only, can be
trusted.
Here's another campaign sheet.
Adams has sons who might aim to succeed
his father.
Jefferson, like Washington, has no son.
So all of that kind of concern, anxiety,
about dynasty is
kind of packed into these, these this very
compact phrase, 35 years.
So it's actually a democratic, it's, it's
hugely powerful, the
geo-strategic argument that we've been
talking about is embodied in the
presidency, creating a muscular
presidency, that's going to be able to
stand up against Kings and Emperors and
Tzars around the world.
But it's also, and that's one of
our big themes, how geo-strategic the
Constitution is.
How focused it is on national security.
But remember another theme is how
Democratic the document is.
No property qualifications, no religious
qualifications.
Presidents can actually be elected in, in
some ways by the people.
I'm going to talk about that in just a
minute with the Electoral College.
and, and anti-dynastic rules like the
35-year-old clause.
Anti-nobility rules, which is what the
natural-born Citizen idea is, in this
essence, all about, we're going to pay
him, this president so that the
people without vast amounts of wealth
could be eligible to serve, just
as the paying members of the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
Now, what about the Electoral College?
You've been taught that they came up
with an electoral college, rather than
direct election,
because they didn't believe in democracy.
But I've just given you a bunch of
evidence that they really were Democrats
at the founding.
And they put the constitution to a vote.
We the people of the Unites States, an
unprecedentedly inclusive vote.
And they believe in direct election of
governors.
And they're actually creating a presidency
that will
be a model for direct election of
Governors.
And they create a House of Representatives
that's directly elected in a
way that wasn't true of the Congress and
the Articles of Confederation.
So I don't think it's actually fair to
say, oh, they, they created the electoral
congress because they really didn't
believe in
democracy, because they were afraid of, of
democratic
power.
So I don't think that actually explains
the data.
And you've been taught, oh, the electoral
college
is a balance between large states and
small states.
Well, the house and the senate, that's a
balance between popular states and less
popular states.
But not the electoral college, the
electoral
college, the big state guy wins every
time.
We've only had three small state
presidents in all of American history.
Bill Clinton, Franklin Pierce and Zach,
Zachary Taylor.
That's it.
Remember, for the first the first
President
is from Virginia, that's the biggest
state.
And then actually, Massachusetts is the
next President, that's
the second or third biggest state
depending on your count.
And then Virginia again with Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe.
For 32 of the first 36 years, it's
Virginia, which is the biggest state.
And for the other four, it's
Massachusetts.
And then for the next four, it's
Massachusetts, which is
the second or third biggest state,
depending on how you count.
It's not a balance between
big and small states.
It's not because they didn't believe in
democracy.
Here's what James Carville would tell you.
It's slavery, stupid.
That's why we have an electoral college.
In a world of direct election, the South
loses every time.
Because a huge proportion of its
population is slave population.
So, obviously, they don't vote.
But, in the electoral college system, the
South gets to count its slave
albeit at a discount, the three-fifths
clause, but
still gets to count its slaves, so the
three-fifths
clause is built in not just to the
house of representatives, but the
electoral college as well.
And it's going to end up with the
presidency that
ends up skewing very much in favor of the
south.
So, Who's the big winner in this electoral
college
world, it's Virginia it's a large state
that gets to
count its slaves, Pennsylvania in 1800 has
more free
citizens then Virginia, way more voters
then Virginia in 1800.
But, Virginia has more electoral votes
because Virginia gets to
count its slaves as do all the southern
states three-fifths.
Our electoral college system is,
basically, very much
part of the three-fifths compromise, very
much a pro-slavery
accommodation constitution.
If this wasn't crystal clear.
Every American, when the Constitution was
being proposed, it soon
became so when 2 elections between a
southerner, Thomas Jefferson, and
a northerner, John Adams, as soon as
George Washington leaves the
scene And the south votes for the
southerner twice, Thomas Jefferson.
And the north votes for the
northerner, John Adams, twice.
New York is the swing state.
First goes for Adams in 1796 and then for,
for Jefferson later on.
We're going to talk a lot about that
election in later
lectures, but it was clear to all that
basically this
is the South against the North, and the
three-fifths clause
is playing a huge part in all, in all of
that.
That's what we're going to see in later
chapters.
Without three-fifths actually John Adams
wins even that second election.
He loses against Jefferson in the rematch
because Jefferson is benefiting from the
extra three
fifths that the southern states are
getting because
three fifths is built into the electoral
college.
So we have the electoral college.
For reasons of slavery, were going to come
back to this again
and again, cause one question is, should
we continue to have it?
If that's what it's all about.
Now, I promised at the beginning of this
session, about the presidency,
that you're going to be able to see all
the great themes of article two.
In this painting, 1796, is the Washington
family.
Let me just identify what some of those
themes are and, and you see here.
So one, the presidency it's, it's a kind
of a lonely office.
The president here is not surrounded by
other presidents.
Remember, in our previous chapter we saw
Henry Clay.
And, he up there in the senate and there's
John C.
Calhoun
and there's Daniel Webster Congress is a
collective body.
Present, one person.
And he's got his family all around him.
But there's not a, a Congress of, of
presidents.
And no one's quite looking directly at
him.
It's a bit of a lonely office, actually.
So you see George Washington.
And what's he wearing?
He's wearing his general's uniform.
You see, it's a geo-strategic and military
office.
George Washington becomes the first
President in part because he commit,
partly because you can trust him and I'll
tell you, because of, of, he has no heir
to the throne who bears his name.
No George the second, and we're going to
talk about that in a minute.
But party because he had an army under his
disposal and gave it up.
He was the only guy with an army on
the continent during the Civil during the
Revolutionary War and
in 1783, he hands his commission over.
He, he disbands the army, he goes to the
farm.
You can trust him.
He's a general, he'll be able to protect
you against the British.
You see this globe down here in the
corner?
It's a geo-strategic office that's all
about foreign
affairs, and he's wearing his general's
uniform, but
you can trust him because he's not
going to
try to stra, stage a military coup d'etat.
He, he could have done that during the
American Revolution and didn't.
He's not going to be a Napoleon.
Napoleon hasn't quite emerged on the
scene, but he's, he's not going to
be another, when Washington was elected,
Napoleon hasn't emerged on the scene.
By the time of this, this painting,
actually,
some Americans have, have begun to hear of
Napoleon.
But he's not going to become a Napoleon.
A Julius Caesar's going to make himself
Emperor Caesar you can trust him.
He's going to be big enough to, to go
against the Brits.
It's a foreign policy office to defend us.
All the early presidents are basically,
elected presidents
are basically battlefield generals or
secretaries of state, so
foreign policy office John Adams was, in
effect, Secretary
of State, leading diplomat in the articles
of confederation.
Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State,
James Madison, James Monroe.
All of the early elected presidents, all
the way
up until Lincoln, are either secretaries
of state slash
America's leading diplomat or battlefield
generals like Andy Jackson.
Like William Henry Harrison.
Like Franklin Pierce.
The only elected president up til Lincoln,
who is not
a leading diplomat or a battlefield
general, is James K.
Polk.
So, it's a foreign policy office.
It's a militant, it, it's Commander in
Chief.
It's about Geo-strategy.
We see all of that.
It's lonely, here.
It's a lonely office.
We see, the lurking presence of slavery in
the corner.
There's actually Billy Lee Washington's
favorite slave, whom he frees.
On his death, actually.
Setting a model, a precedent as
ex-president.
Trying to, to set a model for his country
that,
alas, is not emulated by all the great
slaveholders of Virginia.
But Washington does provide for the
freeing of his slaves,
the ones that he owns at his death.
And Billy Lee is one of them.
But we see kind of the presence of slavery
in this early a, a presidency.
One final thing.
What we see and don't see.
This is the Washington family.
And this is a step grandson, a Custis, a
step granddaughter.
They do not bear the Washington name.
They do not bear his blood.
They are not going to be heirs to
the throne.
In some ways the saddest feature of this,
and it, there's a certain solemnity
here, but also a certain, maybe sadness
is, there's an emptiness in the middle.
What's not here?
There's the rising S U N, the American
empire on the rise, sort of,
as, a, a, so a rising S U N, a rising sun
But no S O N, Washington
has no kids of his own.
And there's sadness there.
That's what he doesn't have.
But precisely because of that, we can
trust him.
We can trust him because he's a military
officer.
Who could have made himself president but
didn't.
Who can beat the British, we can trust him
because he has no son of his own.
He has a lot of wealth and power, party
because he is
a Virginian who does own slaves and
marries a very wealthy Virginia widow.
So that's all part of it.
But the anti-dynastic feature is here too.
Maybe the most important
part of this painting is what is not
there.
Namely, an heir to the throne.
In our next sessions, we're going to talk
more about America's presidency, so stay
tuned.
