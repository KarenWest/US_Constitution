>> Hello, I'm Lucas Swineford, the
executive director of
the Yale University Office of Online
Education and Digital Dissemination.
I'm part of the behind the scenes team
working with professor Amar
to bring his constitutional law course to
students around the world, online.
This course follows a consistent
structure, organized
by chapters in Professor Amar's two books.
As the professor outlined in his course
introduction, he will deliver two lecture
segments for each chapter, then include a
third, more interactive segment for each
chapter.
We've decided that this third segment
won't follow just one path.
We'll experiment with different
approaches.
Some of the segments will be live video
discussions
scheduled while the course is actually in
session online.
Others may be specific prompts to enter a
discussion forum.
And others yet, will be conversations
between professor Amar, and a guest.
Now that guest might be a current Yale
undergraduate, a professional colleague of
professor Amar, or simply
a curious life long learner who brings a
specific
domain perspective outside of the law or
legal studies.
Now you can add me to this final camp.
One of the exciting aspects of this third
segment is that it will be experimental
and evolving.
We look forward to hearing from you what
works best as the course progresses.
For our first chapter though, I have the
opportunity
to ask Professor Amar a few followup
questions from his first lecture.
Professor Amar, thanks for this
opportunity and for
having me on segment one if you will.
>> Thank you.
>> Now, as someone immersed in the
world of
digital communications and technology, you
know, I think a great
deal about how news and events travel
throughout the
world instantly through social networks
and other forms of technology.
Now, in your first lecture you mentioned
how this was
a real pivot point in the history of the
world.
But now, obviously that
effect could not have been felt
immediately, so what was
the process for the rest of the world when
this happened?
How did news and impact of The
Constitution and this decision reverberate
around the world?
How long did it take and what did that
process look like?
>> Well eventually it will take
centuries.
It's really in the 20th century that the
the American vision of, of democracy
really turns the
corner in world history.
And, and, Western Europe, and Eastern
Europe, and now, huge parts of, of
Asia and even Africa are, are coming on
board, South America, Central America.
So it, it, it does take a long time, but
from the beginning,
the framers dream great dreams.
Let's take the Declaration
of Independence.
It talks about.
Who's its audience?
It says, let facts be submitted to a
candid world.
We're going to try to make our case for
the rightness
of our revolt our, our revolution, our
declaring of independence.
We're going to try to make that case, not
just for
ourselves and our fellow Americans, but we
want to appeal to the,
enlightened subjects of the world.
The philosophs in France, and, and, the
believers in the enlightenment.
So, let facts be submitted to a candid
world,
says Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration
of, of independence.
In the Federalist Papers, oh, let me back
up.
when, George Washington has an army under
his command,
the Continental Army, the painter,
Benjamin West, is
asked, well, what will happen if the war
ends?
And and he's asked that by King George III
of England.
And, and West says, well they say he's
going to
disband the army and go back to his farm
and
George III is reputed to have replied, if
he does
that, he will be the greatest man in the
world.
because,
because, before that, strongmen military
figures had basically
used their armies to make themselves
kings, emperors, tzars.
Julius Caesar Oliver Cromwell, Darius
Darius in, in, in, and in American
English, Xerxes.
Napoleon's going to shortly thereafter
take, because he's got an army,
he's going to take a crown and put it
on his own head and, and proclaim himself
Emperor.
And Washington does not do that and George
III himself, maybe the most powerful
monarch in the world says, if Washington
does that, boy that's going to be
something.
So, so the world is watching.
This is even before The Constitution and
when The Constitution comes
along, let me read to you the language of
the Federalist
number one.
These are a series of, of newspaper
op-eds,
published by the supporters of The
Constitution anonymously.
They're written by John Jay, and Alexander
Hamilton, and James Madison.
This is the opening paragraph of the
Federalist number one.
Second sentence.
It says, well okay, we're now deliberating
your call to
deliberate on The Constitution for the
United States of America.
The subject
speaks its own importance.
And then, and then, then, then, the next
sentence.
It has been frequently remarked that it
seems to have been reserved to the people
of this country, by their conduct and
example, to decide the important question
whether societies
of men are really capable or not
of establishing good government from
reflection and choice,
or whether they are forever destined to
depend
for their political constitutions on
accident and force.
We, these people in the United States
this,
on the periphery of the civilized world,
just
a few million people way away from the
great cities and, and, and civilized
centers, this audacity.
We are going to, it's going to be our
example that
will decide whether democracy can really
be made to work.
Let me read you one other framer.
This is, I think I may have made reference
to this in one of my early lectures.
James Wilson, a man who comes over from
Scotland, on July 4, 1788, The
Constitution's been ratified
by ten states, enough for it to go into
effect formally.
And thousands of people are gathering in
Philadelphia
to celebrate this, and here's what he
says.
The spectacle which we are assembled to
celebrate is the most
dignified one that's yet appeared on our
globe.
And he says, you've heard of Sparta, of
Rome, of Athens, you know, but did they in
all did they ever furnish to the world, an
exhibition similar to that to which we now
contemplate.
So, these guys, they're so audacious.
They, even if the world isn't following
every single move in real time
with rapt attention, the framers of, of,
or the architects
of the American Revolution and then later
the framers of The
Constitution, are under the impression,
maybe they're delusional, that what they
do will matter for all time and for the
entire planet.
That they're going to either you know,
approve or
disprove the fundamental reality the
workability of, of democratic
self governance.
Now as a practical matter, here's what
happens immediately.
So it takes time for any news to
disseminate.
You know, weeks or months to cross the
Atlantic in, in ships.
We don't have the internet or even
telegraph or telephone.
Okay, but news does disseminate.
The French stage a revolution shortly
after the American Constitution.
It's, it's lead in part by people like
Lafayette, who have spent time in America.
It tries to do some very democratic
things.
I think it, it fails pretty quickly, and,
and we result and the result is an
absolutist monarch Napoleon, who, who, it,
has reigns in an authoritarian way.
So that project fails, but it's inspired
in some ways, by the American experience.
There are democratic
reforms in the 1840s in Europe and, and
they largely collapse in 1848.
As late as the Civil War, Lincoln is
basically
saying, listen, if we can't get our acts
together here
in the United States, then the project of
democratic self-governance
will perhaps be seen as delusional What
does Lincoln say?
You know, we are
the last best hope of Earth.
It is up to us here in America to prove
the government of
the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the Earth.
So, you know, as late as the 1860s, the
Civil War,
the success of the American project is
still in the balance.
Only when American project, I think,
conclusively succeeds with the
Civil War does it become pretty clear that
democracy is here
to stay, here to stay on a big scale.
And then, in the 20th century you've got
World War I, you know,
which it claims to be a war to make the
world safe for democracy.
World War II, in which the democratic
powers basically prevail against the
authoritarian powers.
And that's partly because this project of
we the people of
the United States, succeeds in its
military ambitions and its democratic
ambitions.
So it takes a long time,
but, but they believe that the world is
watching from day one.
Maybe they're a little delusional on that.
They have a, too much of a sense of their
own importance.
On the other hand, it turns out they were
right about all that.
>> I have to say that I love the fact
that implied in that question,
is how citizens of the world are
using personal technology to access and
share information.
And the first thing you did was pull up
some information on your smart phone.
>> Oh, exactly.
>> But
that's fantastic, and we did not plan
that.
>> No.
>> That's excellent.
so, there was something else you mentioned
in here.
Now of course, in today's political
climate, we've almost gotten
conditioned to and used to this idea of
the comeback kid.
That politicians can make what we think,
maybe at the
time, are huge mistakes, and somehow come
back from that.
But there are still some, some things,
some events that go
on, even in contemporary society, that
when a politician makes a misstep,
your immediate thought is, well that's a
career ender.
And you mentioned one that seemed that way
to me.
James Monroe, I believe, opposed the
Constitution,
one of a number of politicians who did.
He then went on to become president.
How did that happen?
Thinking through the lens of today, I
cannot see you being on
the wrong side of history, such a big
decision, and coming back.
How did that happen?
>> So, there are some things from which
some huge political
blunders from which no comeback is
possible.
And in 1776, when America declares
independence, basically you
either are on the right side of history or
not.
And, if you oppose The Declaration of
Independence and the
American Revolution in the mid-1770s,
basically you're cast off the island.
You're not, you're never heard of again,
politically.
No one who opposes independence in 1776
who doesn't sort of quickly change his
mind, there are a couple people who change
their mind in 1777, 1788, while, while
the, the war still hung in the balance.
But no one who was a diehard loyalist, a
supporter of George III, ever
goes on to be an important political
figure in independent America.
So that one, we're in a war.
This is life or death.
You're either with us or against us, and,
and if
your against us, then, you know, screw
you, you know.
You're, you're, you know, there's no
redemption from that.
No second chance.
That's 1776.
And what's so interesting is that's not
1787, 88.
There are people who fiercely oppose the
Constitution.
Not just James Monroe, becomes president,
Elbridge
Gerry who becomes vice president, George
Clinton, who becomes
vice president, Samuel Chase, who is the
supreme court justice.
so, how do these people, they oppose The
Constitution, they're anti-federalists,
how do they make a comeback?
Here's my claim.
In 1788, it's a time of peace, not war.
We can have a, a, a conversation in which
maybe we might disagree, but there's more
mutual respect.
This is not quite life or death.
And I'm going to read actually, again
from, I read
you again from the opening paragraph of
Federalist One.
That was written by Alexander Hamilton.
I'm now going to read you language from
the
Federalist Two, which is written by John
Jay.
So these are the opening, and there are 85
of these op-eds overall.
These are the opening passages of, of, of,
of these op-eds.
And here's
what, what John Jay says.
He says, basically Providence has been
pleased, God has been
pleased, to give this one connected
country to one united people.
A people descended from the same
ancestors.
Not quite true, you see, there are
actually, you know,
people from many different countries here
in the United States.
Speaking the same language, that's not
quite true.
A third of Pennsylvanians
speak German as their first language.
Professing the same religion?
Well not quite.
We've got Catholics and Protestants and
among the
Protestants, Anglicans and
Congregationalists
and Baptists and Quakers.
And you know, so attached to the same
principles of government?
Yes.
Very similar in their manners and customs?
Well, to some extent, slavery is a very
different custom in different parts of the
country.
Here's the key.
And who by their joint councils arms and
efforts, fighting side by side
throughout a long and bloody war, have
nobley established their general liberty
and independence.
We fought together.
That's what has made us united.
And yes, we might disagree.
Some are us are for the Constitution, some
of us are
against it, but we are all Americans
because we all fought together.
The National Security idea,
that's what formed this.
James Monroe fought in the American
Revolution right with
George Washington, and so that's what
gives him credibility.
Here's the next sentence from, from, from,
Jay, or the next sentence and a half.
He, he refers to
Americans as a band of brethren.
Now where's he getting
that idea from?
You know, from Shakespeare, Henry V.
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,
for he that sheds his blood
today with me, shall be my brother.
Be he ne're so vile, this day shall
gentle his condition.
And gentlemen in England, now abed
shall think themselves accursed they were
not here, and, and, hold their
manhoods cheap, while any speaks that
fought with us upon Saint Christmas day.
So, if you fight with me, you know, on my
side, in
a war of a life and death war of a
national liberation independence,
you're my brother.
James Monroe is a loyal American.
He proves that in, on the battlefields of
the American Revolution.
So 1776, listen, you're either on our side
or the Brits and, and
if you're on their side then no, you're
never going to be a political leader.
>> That's it.
>> But if you're on the, the right side
of the American Revolution, it's
okay to be on the wrong side, so to speak,
of the Constitution because
we're all in this together.
And by the way, you know, maybe you were
right about some things.
Maybe that Constitution wasn't perfect.
Maybe we do need a Bill of Rights.
And so very quickly the Federalists are
reaching out to the James Monroes of the
world, the, the Elbridge Gerrys, the
George Masons,
the George Clinton's to try bring them in.
And that, we call that process The Bill of
Rights.
So, I think we see
in that the importance of national
security and, and loyalty.
James Monroe becomes presidential because
he fights with
George Washington even though he opposed
Washington's Constitution.
>> So I would change the perspective a
bit from an individual to a, to a group.
And I really liked your description of
this idea of
the world's largest corporate merger, of
bringing all the states together.
And there were two states that you
mentioned in particular, Rhode Island and
North Carolina,
that were not in the corporate merger at
first.
So can you talk a little about that
process?
How did did they change their minds?
Were there some specific events or people
who stood up and
really lead them to join, join the merger
if you will?
>> It's the perfect segue from what we
just spoke about.
The biggest objections of the
anti-federalists are twofold.
One, Congress is too small, to be
really trustworthy and, and, and
representative.
And two, there's no Bill of Rights.
So what does the first Congress do
immediately?
They basically propose a series of
amendments.
Actually one of the amendments is about
congressional size.
It doesn't get ratified, but it promises a
bigger congress, and even without that
amendment, Congress very
shortly says, oh we're going to have a
census and
as soon as we have a census, we will
have a bigger House of Representatives.
So, check, you, you, you had, you had that
criticism.
That's valid.
We're addressing that.
You said in North Carolina, you said in
Rhode Island, you wanted a Bill of Rights.
And by the way, a lot of, of people in the
States that said,
yes, the dissenters, the, the
anti-federalists, the
James Monroes of the world, he's from
Virginia.
Virgina said yes, but there are a lot of
people like James Monroe in Virginia
who said, where are the Bill of Rights?
So what does the first Congress do?
It proposes a bill of rights and then it's
giving the
skeptics, the critics, in Rhode Island and
North Carolina, but also in other states.
the, the James Monroes of the world is, is
letting them save face.
Okay, you oppose this constitution.
You made some criticisms.
We've heard you.
We've tried to address those criticisms.
Now, this is your constitution too.
You are kind of founding fathers with us.
You are the authors of our first set of
revisions.
So now come join us.
We, we heard what you said.
We were, kind of, we voted yes, you voted
no, but you know, we were closer,
than that might indicate because even
though we voted yes, we heard
you that the version isn't perfect.
We heard that you wanted a bill of rights.
We heard you wanted a bigger house
of representatives, and we're moving in
that direction.
Now you know, Peter, we're reaching out
our hand.
Why don't you take it?
And this is brilliant.
This brings the James Monroes, you know,
back onto the island.
and, and, and Rhode Island and North
Carolina have now saved face.
They can say, okay, and even
before the Bill of Rights is ratified,
it's been proposed by Congress.
It's for out in the states and Rhode
Island and North Carolina can say okay,
that's enough of a signal that, that this
system is not going to be tyrannical.
It's going to be sort of open to, to our
criticisms.
They heard us.
>> Seems there.
>> We won.
>> Seems like there are lessons in
working together that we can apply, even
today.
>> Abs, absolutely.
The, the way in which,
the winners have to win, and it's
simple majority rule in, in the individual
states.
So majorities have to rule, and
ultimately, minorities have to acquiesce,
otherwise.
But, minorities won't acquiesce if they
don't feel
that they've been heard they've been
listened to.
So I think there are some interesting
lessons for us today.
>> Absolutely.
Well Professor Amar, thank you so much.
I feel like we can go on for quite some
time, but we are
going to stop here and allow the students
to move onto the next section.
Thank you very much.
>> Thank you.
