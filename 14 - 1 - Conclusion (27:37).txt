[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
I've begun most of the lectures in
this MOOC series with those words, welcome
back.
And I say them now and, and it's a
little bit bittersweet because I think
this is the
last time I will be able to say those
words to you, because this is our final
concluding lecture.
And in this lecture, I'd like to do
several things.
I'd like to thank you, I'd like to remind
you,
I'd like to advise you and I'd like to
challenge you.
So, first, my thank you, is
if, if you've made it this far, you've
gone through an awful lot,
we've many, many hours of of this MOOC
series, this massive open on-line course,
series.
And at one level this is a free course.
It's designed to be accessible to, to you
all.
There are no required texts, there's no
tuition, no property qualifications, as it
were.
But at another level, it's of course a
very expensive course.
Because your time is valuable, it's
precious.
It's the most precious thing to you and
you've chosen to spend a lot of that time
to be part of this experience and, and I
personally am very grateful to you.
And, and I actually think that your,
your fellow citizens are, and should be
grateful.
The constitutional project does not work
unless every, in every generations,
thousands,
millions frankly, of Americans buy into
the project and participate in it.
They, they have to show up to vote.
To serve on juries when called to, to do
public service when, when summoned by
their fellow citizens.
To pay their taxes and ultimately their
obligation in, involves not merely
speaking but, but listening, not just
freedom of speech but a duty to listen.
Not just voting but deliberating and
thinking, learning,
understanding our constitutional system,
and that does take effort.
And that's the effort that you've all put
into
this course, and so again, I thank you for
that.
Now, I want to give you all, I want,
having thanked you, I
want to remind you of that about what the
course has been about.
It's organized around two books, America's
Constitution: A Biography,
and America's Unwritten Constitution: The
Precedents and Principles We Live By.
And just by way of reminder, here's what
we did.
We started with a very careful and
comprehensive
tour through this tourist text, the
written constitution.
And I hope we learned several things,
from,
from that tool, which aimed to be
comprehensive.
We saw how well organized the text was, it
begins with this idea
of popular sovereignty, we the people,
then
it talks about the legislature, article
one
the executive, article two the judicial,
article three the states, article four the
constitutional supremacy principals of of
amendment and
ordainment in articles five, six, and
seven.
So its we saw the, the general
organization of, of the thing as a whole.
And then we went through the amendments,
and I hope you saw a second feature of
the constitution is inter-generational
equality because the amendments
of course are added as so many post
scripts,
and post post scripts, PPSes in
chronological order,
and so at the end of, toward the end of
those lectures in the
first half of the course, we carried the
story forward in time.
We began with a kind of a funcitional
organization.
A legislative power, executive power, a
judicial power,
federalism, horizontally, and vertically.
But then we move from that functional
organization story to a chronological
story, through
the Bill of Rights, and then the
Reconstruction Amendments adopted after
the Civil War.
The Progressive Era Amendments in the 19
teens.
The 1960s amendments kind of a second
reconstruction constitutionally ending
poll-tax disfranchisement, opening up the
vote still further to, to young adults.
So that was the first book a, a guided
tour of the, and I hope
a comprehensive one of the written
constitution,
seeing its organization and its
inter-generational chronological, flow.
And then, in the second half of the
course,
we focused on the fact that the
constitution is more.
Our constitutional culture, our
constitutional experience,
constitutional law goes beyond this terse
text.
It encompass it, to be sure.
We would never want to lose a connection
to the written constitution.
But we talked about things beyond the
written constitution.
And in particular, we, by the end of, of,
of that experience, I hope
we came to see that the constitution,
America's constitution really combines at
least four elements.
Let me summarize them.
There's the terse text, the written
constitution.
That's one way in which we talk about a
constitution.
There are unwritten principles of, of
higher law, limiting government
that are not all textual specified but are
still part of our constitutional system.
Many of these unwritten rules and
principles are judicially enforceable.
Others, even though they're not in the
text explicitly, others may not be
judiciously enforceable, but they still
are
binding in legal conscience upon
non-judicial actors.
And 225 years ago when the constitution
is being launched, that idea, the
constitution has
higher principles that are really binding
even if not set forth in the terse text.
That idea would have been very
recognizable, by both Americans and
Englishmen.
Englishmen, of course, don't have, Britons
don't have a written constitution in
this way, but they do have unwritten
principles that are understood to bind.
Sometimes judicially, other times extra
judicially outside the judiciary.
A third idea of a constitution.
A constitution are, is how the government,
how the society, the polity is
constituted.
The procedures and protocols and processes
by
which the government is organized and, and
constituted.
That, idea, as well, would have been a
well-understood by the
British because that is the British
constitution, how the government is
organized.
We pave, we paid particular attention to
some of the features, of some of the
institutional features, and constitutive
features
of our system that a somehow entrenched,
made difficult to change.
Some of these entrenchments are highly
formal and legal,
even if not textually specified, they're
enforceable in court.
Principles of separation of powers and
federalism that a court might
enforce against ordinary legislative
change
even though they're not written down.
So some of these are judicially
enforceable, others
of them might operate, not so much by
court order but
the more informal mechanisms of
entrenchment, for example America's
two party system is a practical matter we
have duopoly.
They're two big parties, that's part of
our basic system of government.
And that maybe not judicially forced all
the time,
but it's a fundamental and entrenched
feature of the constitution.
So these first three ideas of that
constitution is,
I think would have been well understood at
the founding.
The terse test unwritten rules and, and
principles of
higher law that constrain, and the way in
which
the government is basically organized and
constituted the basical,
the basic institutional procedures and
protocols and principles and processes.
Now to those three elements I've
encouraged us to think about a fourth.
The constitution also encompasses the
tools and techniques by
which we make constitutional arguments,
and read the constitution.
This doesn't come, this little document
here doesn't come with a
specific and comprehensive set of rules
about how its to be interpreted.
These rules are themselves part of
America's constitutional system,
and and so what I hope we, we we've seen
through the course is how these different
elements that terse text, the unwritten,
higher law principles, the organization of
the
system as a whole, and the tools
and techniques of interpretation all fit
together.
because, even though the first half
focused more on the terse text and
the second half went beyond it, I hope in
the second half we always kept the text in
mind, because the text is connected to the
implicit principles, the
enacting and ordaining and amending deeds,
the lived constitutional
experiences the landmark cases, the iconic
symbols of, of national unity, the basic
structures and institutions of
government power, the state constitutional
counterparts.
The written constitution is intermittently
intertwined with all
of those other elements of our
constitutional culture.
And so, I hope you see that even though
we've had to go beyond the
terse text, we've always tried to, to
connect to it and keep it in mind.
So that was by way of reminder.
I started, with, I will thank you and I
want to
remind you, two things left to advise you
and to challenge you.
On advice you might say, okay, well,
professor, reaching the end of this
experience, what next if we're interested
in learning more, what should we do?
Well, one thing of course it's not at all
a course requirement I hope it hasn't been
but
if you do want to have a, get a
lot more detailed understanding of the
constitution in general
and, and of these lectures in particular
feel free
to go to a local library or a local
bookstore or go online and get copies of
America's
Constitution: A Biography or America's
Unwritten Constitution: The Precedents and
Principles We Live By.
These are, not expensive textbooks.
You can get a used copy on Amazon for, I
think,
maybe 5 or $6, for the first book which is
in paperback.
And the second one isn't in paperback yet,
but I hope
it will be soon, and I think is $20 on
Amazon.
And again remind, to remind you bookstores
have them, but so do libraries.
So you do, you do not need to, to pay a
penny in
order to experience the, the more detailed
information that you'll find in those
books.
And you say okay, well professor, now even
after I've read those books, what next?
Well, each of those books, and they're
pretty hefty here, each
is about 500 pages of, of text, has 100
pages of end
notes that have all sorts of references to
other books and
articles that you might read, depending on
what's of interest to you.
I tried to write these to guide, the
reader and, to other, I think, interesting
accounts.
And, and if you wanted one recommendation
right now, you're not going to
be surprised, but you, that you can
probably predict what I'm going to
say if you, the first thing probably to,
to, to read in
addition to these books that I, I'd be
delighted if you experienced.
The first thing of course is the
Federalists Papers.
The which are again they're available
actually online, for free,
you can get paperback copy for five or six
bucks.
All libraries have them, most book stores
have them.
And if you've read the books you've read
my
two books, and you've looked at the end
notes,
and you've read the Federalist Papers, and
you still
want more, just Google my name, email me,
tell me
what you've read, tell me what you liked
about
what you read, tell me what you didn't
like,
and I'll be happy to give you more reading
suggestions depending on your particular
tastes and interests So there
are, there's a vast literature out there
and depending on
your interests, you can go in all sorts of
different directions
and I have tried to give you literally
hundreds of
suggestions, reading suggestions, in the
end notes, to these two books.
Okay, so I thanked you, and I reminded
you, and I've
advised you.
I wana, I wana end by challenging you.
Remember how we began this, course.
We talked about how the constitution's
preamble.
We the People of the United States.
And remember, I'm going to have to say
something about this image here cause
I, I always do that, that's part of the
course, so I will.
And this is the image that we started
with.
But this preamble, we the people of the
United
States, dot dot dot, do ordain and
establish this constitution.
That was an epically democratic deed.
It was the hinge of human history.
It changed everything.
Never had so many people gotten together
to
decide how they and their posterity would
be governed.
The world would never be the same.
And it was also, a massive corporate
merger of sorts.
13 different colonies forming one
genuinely united system.
It was nothing less, really than world
government for the new world.
Democratic world government for a new
world
new continent, separated by vast oceanic
moats from
the ancient, the, the monarchies, and, and
oligarchies and tyrannies of, of the
ancient world.
So, it was democratic world government for
a new world.
And it was premised on the idea that the
new world was basically isolated
kind of an island continent separated from
the old world and and the, the question
is whether that makes sense today, that
vision
because here are two things that are, two
big fundamental things that have changed.
The rest of the world is democratic in a
way that it wasn't before.
Much of it is.
At the time of the founding there were
only
a couple of, of self-governing societies
outside the New World.
Switzerland and Great Britain.
Now, half the planet is democratic.
On the con, on the model of the American
Constitution, written constitutions, free
elections, free speech, religious
tolerance a peaceful
transfers of powers between competing
political parties.
For example, a billion people in India,
that's where my parents
came from, are now self governing on the
American constitutional model.
And so, so, the rest of the world is much
more American than before.
And so maybe we, you know, the question,
the challenge is, should we be
as isolationist in our thinking, and
constitutional
thinking, as, as we have been thus far?
So, the rest of the world is more
democratic, and, it's a smaller planet.
The framers idea was that, that these vast
oceanic moats would protect us.
That the key is that we wouldn't need a
big standing army, in, in peace time.
Because, we had the Atlantic Ocean to keep
the bad guys away
and, and for 150 years, there is no major
standing army in peace
time in America, and that was a huge part
of America's success is
that it didn't have to have a big standing
army in peace time.
But the world has changed and and the
question is
whether constitutional thinking needs to,
to change along side it.
When the constitution was being proposed,
it was a, as
I said, it was as if there was world
government.
And, and there's nothing, and, and it was
designed to protect us
against the British, the constitution was
as a continental defense system, common
defense.
We the people of the United States in
order to,
dot, dot, dot, provide for the common
defense, and it
was about protecting us against the Brits,
and the Spanish,
and the French and, and, and others who
would tyrannize.
But, and today if I said well we need to
think about, your
generation needs to think seriously about
world government on the democratic scale.
We haven't talked about that very much in
this course.
But, but the challenge is for you to begin
to think about that.
You might say, well, you know, there's,
you know, what do you mean professor?
Do you mean we have to think seriously
about whether we should
ever have a legislature, elected
legislature of the world that could actual
pass laws, and impose taxes, and have an
army, and, and you
say, there's nothing imaginable that would
make me ever vote for that professor.
You might pause and say, well, unless the
Martians came.
And if the Martians were coming say, well,
you know, maybe
we have our disagreements with the
Chinese, or, or the, the Russians.
But, but they are homo sapiens, so we're
in.
That's actually what motivated Americans
225 years ago.
The Virginians have their disagreements
with the Massachusetts
people who have their disagreements with
the New Yorkers.
But the Martians were coming, the British
threat
was a real one and an ongoing one, and
the Spanish and frankly the French too,
and and
so common a continental defense
arrangement was agreed to.
But the question is today whether really
actually
is it really true that the Martians aren't
coming?
Think about all the things that maybe
require, not just continental
coordination, but, global coordination.
Climate change.
Pandemic viruses.
International terrorism.
Nuclear proliferation.
Maybe the Martians are coming in all these
ways.
Maybe the Martians are carbon dioxide
molecules that
are heating up the planet and will and
whose solution will require not just
continental governance systems, but global
governance systems.
And the same is true, as I said for,
arguably, for nuclear proliferation and
international terrorism and, and pandemic
viruses, and global opportunities.
We now have the internet and supersonic
travel.
And, because of nuclear submarines and
intercontinental missiles, we
are no longer separated from the rest of
the world.
We might try to imagine we could build
some
sort of, of protective bubble around this
hemisphere or something.
But it's not going to be so easy when
you've got nuclear submarines just right
off your coast.
So I end the postscript of the second book
with a challenge.
And I want to, sort of end this this
little section with a, with a challenge.
About creating genuinely democratic,
global
constitutional systems, global governance
systems.
Systems in which the American idea of, of
democracy
on a broad scale is extended possibly even
further.
Here's how I end, I say, you know, gee,
this is I, I,
I don't know how that would work, and, and
frankly I think I'm,
I think I'm probably to old to figure it
out, because, I say, here's a quote,
the best ideas may well come from the
young, that's you.
Madison and Hamilton were both in their
mid 30s when they composed the
lion's share of the Federalist Essays,
championing world government for the new
world.
Whereas Publius was a joint product of
three men, John Jay rounded out the
trio, today's technology makes it possible
for
many minds across the planet to
collaborate.
If the blessings of liberty are to be
secured for posterity, not
just for Americans, but for all God's
children, young visionaries must speak up.
Publius II, Publius Jr., Publius the
Second, that's you.
Where are you?
The world awaits your proposals.
So, I ended that second book and then I
end on this
section of the, of the including lecture
with a challenge to you.
And, and the challenge is to start to
think not just about
the future of American constitutionalism,
but
frankly of the future of world
constitutionalism.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Now, there's one last thing to do, of
course, before we, say goodbye.
We have to talk about the image on
the screen, that's been the tradition in
this course.
I end where I started.
with, this montage put together by my
friends, here at,
at, at Yale, it's a montage that as I told
you
at the beginning, blends text, text of the
preamble
with embodied actions in full living
color, actual individuals who did things.
George Washington plays a particularly
important role.
I hope this MOOC has combined actually a
focus on the text, with also the focus on
embodied deeds of, of, a colorful
individuals, and, groups.
This montage is partly taken from the
facade, this,
the side of the National Constitution
center in Philadelphia.
So one other thing, by way of advice, if
you want to get,
experience more about the constitution, go
visit the National Constitution Center in
Philadelphia.
They've got lots of amazing stuff.
So I wanted to sort of remind you of the,
the
image that, that we began this MOOC, this
massive online course with.
But I can't resist the temptation to show
you one other image.
So let's see if this works here.
So, that's Hilary Clinton and that's Bill
Clinton, and they're right here in this
studio.
And they are, and some of the other folks
in the screen are the
crew, that are here at Yale that have
helped put this together, Doug and Rick.
And so I want to, first of all, and
they're
talking about MOOC's, Massive Open Online
Courses, actually, in this studio.
This is a Massive Online Open Course.
And so this is a reminder to me and,
I hope, to you that, that thanks also are,
are
very much due to the, to the good folks
who, on, on the crew who made this MOOC
possible.
And why are they talking about MOOCs?
I mean, by the way, if you look
really, really carefully, there's a little
book there.
It's this book.
It's America's Constitution: a Biography.
And believe it or not, it was hard for me
to believe.
They're actually talking about this book
and this
MOOC in particular and here's why they
are.
Because America's
Constitution was designed to be accessible
to ordinary people.
That's why it was short, so people could
read it.
No property qualifications, is to see and
to read the thing.
And, and this has been a course that's
been
at one level, designed to be accessible to
ordinary people.
No property qualifications, no, no
tuition.
and, and here's why the Clinton's are
interested in,
in that, and I hope all our fellow
citizens are.
The constitution's project doesn't work
without popular education.
This document itself was designed so
ordinary people could
read it and learn about first principles
of government.
The Bill of Rights was so short that
people could
memorize it the way you memorize scripture
or some favorite song.
So the challenge is to make the
constitution,
and to make education, public education
more generally accessible.
Inexpensive.
Free.
Open to all.
You know, I have the great good fortune of
being here at, at Yale.
President Clinton went to, Yale Law
School.
Secretary of State, Clinton went here,
Yale Law School.
We all feel very privileged that we were
able to come here, and study the
constitution.
But it was expensive to do so.
And information wants to be free.
This is education is too expensive, and
this MOOC is part
of an experiment, a project to try to see
if we can open up education and open up
some of the teachings in, in places
like Yale universities to a much broader
audience.
To ideally bring down the cost of public
education, to, to make it accessible more
broadly,
and this MOOC, you know if it worked at
all, it worked because of, of the crew.
And I'd like to thank them, and they, and
so
that's why I wanted to partly end with
this picture.
But of course, this MOOC also, it doesn't
work at
all unless there are folks at the other
end, participating.
That's, that's you.
That's, that's we the people.
That's the only way which this MOOC idea,
the idea of
public education, more generally, the
idea ultimately of constitutional self
government.
Only way it works is if all sorts of
people buy in.
Just take their not necessarily with money
but with their time.
Take the time to actually, be at the other
end of the educational experience.
So I end this lecture where I began with
a, a very big thank you to
each and everyone of you for spending so
much of your precious time, in this MOOC.
And and we've come to the end.
Thank you and farewell.
