Welcome back.
In our previous sessions, we've been
talking about the written Constitution.
We're taking a, a kind of a a leisurely
stroll, a guided
tour, if you will, through the written
constitution, from start to finish.
We've started with the Preamble, we're now
in the middle of
our discussion of Article I, and in later
lectures we'll talk about
Articles II, III, IV, etc.
in textual order.
We'll work our way through to the end of
the written Constitution, and then we'll
start strolling through
the amendments in textual order, which is
also chronological
order, since the amendments have been
added in chronological sequence.
The guidebook for this leisurely tour is a
textbook that I wrote
in 2005.
It's called America's Constitution: A
Biography, it's not
required reading for the course, but it is
available to you, and if you
want more details about the things that
we're talking about in these lectures more
documentation and elaboration and
qualification, citation, all of that.
Then do feel free to pick up a copy
of America's Constitution: A Biography you
can get it at
most public libraries it's also available
in many bookstores online.
I think a paperback copy will run you
about $15 or so.
and, and that book, written for you all,
for a, a general audience
tries to, to as we've been doing in these
lectures, walk you through the written
Constitution in textual order.
There are 12 chapters in that book, and
we've
been going through the book, in effect,
chapter by chapter.
Each chapter has a picture.
And I think that picture is worth a 1,000
words.
It tells a story.
Chapter one opened with a picture of
the first newspaper printing of the
proposed Constitution in
September 1787.
I think that picture captures some big
themes
that people were paying attention to the
proposed Constitution.
That the newspaper published that immed-,
immediately after
the Philadelphia Convention went public
with its proposal.
That newspaper editors understood the
significance of the preamble in
particular,, which appeared in bigger
type, and you see the great
themes of the Constitution in the Preamble
it seems to me.
That's why we spent a whole chapter really
on, on a single sentence.
What are those themes?
Democracy, we the people of the United
States.
geography, it's the people of the United
States, of a continent, of a particular
place.
It's not we the people of, of the world.
And indeed the, the national security is a
third and related idea.
It's, it's us, it's we, and it's us to
some extent against them.
Against the British or the Spanish, the
French, the Native Americans.
This is about the people of the United
States creating a project.
Ordaining and establishing a constitution
in a very democratic way.
Again that democratic idea in
order, among other things, to promote the
common defense.
So again, you see this national security
idea.
And you see it all in this, in this
opening census.
National security, common defense, will
help us secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity.
By keeping the old powers of Europe at
bay,
we will be, we and our descendents will be
free.
We and our posterity will enjoy the
blessings of liberty.
And that
was the Preamble, that was chapter one.
And I think you see those themes in that
opening picture.
Chapter two was about the structure of
Congress.
It was about the opening sections of
Article I of the Constitution.
The Article about the Legislature.
And it was about the structure of the
Congress of the legislature.
Its basic size.
Its
shape.
For example, it has two houses.
It's got a bicameral, symmetric shape.
It we talked about the apportionment rules
in the House
and, and the way in which the Senate was
apportioned.
The House is based on population, the
Senate,
each state, regardless of population, gets
an equal say.
We talked about eligibility rules
for members of the house and senate, who
gets to pick members of the house in the
senate the terms for which the terms of
office that these lawmakers serve.
So, we talked about the basic structure of
Congress and we
began that chapter of a picture that again
is worth 1,000 words.
A picture that shows a big building.
It's a big
building because it's designed to be
the people's branch of government, very
distinctively.
And indeed, Article I very early on echoes
the preamble
in talking about a House of
Representatives from the people.
When you look at that big building, which
is to make sure that the legislature is
going to
be of a sufficient size to be truly
representative
and democratic of the citizenry is that
building also
needs to be big enough to house public
galleries.
Galleries of the people who can watch the
peoples' business being attended to.
So it has to be big enough for that.
You see in the building itself the
bicameralism.
It's kind of a symmetric building with a
House on
one side and a the, the Senate on the
other.
I think in our conversation about Article
I, you saw also some of the, the themes
of, of national security.
The debate about the size of Congress, for
example.
It needs to be democratic, but you also
want to make sure
that the people there actually have some
sense of, of the world.
They have to be a select group, an elite
group of, of some sort in order to
sensibly fashion American foreign policy
defense policy and
the like.
So you don't want the Senate too big
because it's going to need to
be composed of people who really do have a
special understanding about the world.
We talked about how, for example, you want
the longer terms of office for senators
than in, in, in states because, again, of
the need to develop some expertise.
Geography fits into that story too.
Just looking at at
Article I you, you see for example that
they're not annual elections for congress.
Every two years for the House.
And that's partly because it, it takes
awhile to get
from the edges of the continent to the,
the center.
The, the union is, is much bigger of
course than an individual state.
There's more travel time that will be
required.
That was the basic size and
structure of Congress of Article I.
Now we're segueing going into a new
chapter talking about the basic powers of,
of congress and we begin with a picture.
And we're are moving from the outdoor
indoors and here you see Henry Clay.
He's a Senator.
He's addressing the United States Senate
in the antebellum period.
and, and, we see a couple of interesting
things in this picture.
We see that there is a public gallery up
in the balcony.
So, the people are watching.
The Senate didn't begin actually as an
open body.
The House was open to the public from day
one.
The Senate soon followed suit in the mid
1790s and never went back.
So the
people are watching the people's business
being done.
Uniquely, I think, among the three
branches if the Congress
is an entity very much open to public
inspection and deliberation.
That's less true of the Executive Branch,
a lot
of things that executive officials do they
do in secret
espionage and, and, and and
of negotiating treaties.
All sorts of stuff that's not in the
public eye.
Planning de-, de-, de-, defense tactics.
Lots of stuff that happens in the
Executive Branch.
Thinking about whom they're going to
nominate before they name the person.
A lot of things in the Executive Branch
are more secret.
The public isn't there, watching the
president at every moment
in the Oval Office.
But here, they're watching the senators.
Now the senators also, sometimes will be
meeting in private, in cloaked rooms and
the
like, but, but the people are watching
when the senate is engaged in debate,
deliberation.
And this is the age, especially the
antebellum era of,
of America of a famous senatorial oratory,
of the great speeches
that are, are, are, are being offered and
listened to.
So, Henrik Thai is a great orator.
In this chamber actually we see Daniel
Webster is there, John C.
Calhoon is there.
This is a reminder that Congress is a
speech spot.
It's a, a parley place, a place
for political discourse.
In England, they call the Legislature the
Parliament, from the French parler, to
speak.
So this is a place where not only people
vote,
they speak and they are listened to by the
public.
And indeed in Article I, there's a push,
it, it,
we can think of it as one of the great
powers
of Congress.
It's not always conceptualized that way,
but there is a clause in Article I that
affirms the absolute, quote, freedom of
speech
and debate in the House and the Senate.
And, the idea here is that whatever Henry
Clay or Daniel Webster or John C.
Calhoun says today says then or today
Mitch McConnell or
Harry Reid, whatever a Senator says,
whatever a Representative says on the
floor of the Senate, on the floor of the
House is absolutely sacred
free speech.
It cannot be punished outside that body.
Now, if you misbehave and say things that
are inappropriate, the chamber itself
might hold you in contempt or might
discipline you, but you can't be sued
in a court for libel by a private person
who doesn't like what you
said about him or his industry on the
floor of the House or the Senate.
You can't be put in, in prison by judges
or the Executive Branch.
Absolute free speech and debate in the
House and the Senate,
as there was absolute free speech and
debate in Parliament in England.
Now in America, as, as we're going to see
in later lectures not just the
our citizen not just our representatives,
but
the citizens themselves had speech and
debate freedom.
Wi-, the First Amendment is the next free
speech
clause that’s get, getting added to the
constitution, and it’s
going to talk about, again, this idea of
freedom of
speech, just like freedom of speech and,
and, and debate.
But the rights of the citizenry are a
little different
than the rights of law makers.
There is an even more absolute freedom of
speech and debate in the House and the
Senate.
No liable law at all.
If in the real world a citizen gets up
and says something that is intentionally
and maliciously false.
It gets up and just lies to someone's
detriment.
There are libel suits
that can be bought, civil lawsuits for,
for damages that can be brought.
But there's a more absolute freedom of
speech and debate in Congress under the
Constitution.
So this is a very special speech spot, and
we'll
talk more about that freedom of speech
idea in later lectures.
Now, I want to move from Article I,
Sections V and VI that talk about some
of the special immunities and privileges
of members
of, of Congress to Article I Section VIII,
the powers of Congress.
Article I, the first Article, is the
longest article.
Section VIII is within that the longest
section.
So now were going to be talking about the
longest section of the first and longest
article of
the Constitution, so something important
here is going on.
The important thing is that the powers of
Congress are very
broad, but still enumerated, finite, they
are not infinite.
Now, the question of how much power the
central government should have
and within the central government, how
much power the Legislature should have.
These were really
important issues in the 1700s and they
remain so today.
Let me just remind you that the British
Empire
basically breaks up, in a sense over this
question.
A question that's called the question of
federalism in part.
What should the central government do,
what
should be left to the individual component
units?
So,
in the 1760's and 1770's the question was,
what
could Parliament do, and what could
Parliament not do?
Before the 1760's, there had been a kind
of
a working understanding in America, that
Parliament could regulate imperial
affairs, trade within the Empire, foreign
affairs between the
Empire and the other powers of the world,
France and
Spain and so on.
So Parliament could regulate that and
local governments, the colonies, would
basically
deal with taxation and lots of in-,
internal matters.
But then, beginning with the, the Stamp
Act, or the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act and the Townsend
Duties and, and the coercive acts in
the 1760s and 1770s.
Parliament get, begins to pass all sorts
of
laws that, that, it, are designed to raise
revenue from the colonies to regulate
internal matters
in the colonies, and the col-, colonists
pushed back.
They say, wait a minute, you can't do
that.
And the British say well, listen if we can
legislate for anything
in the Empire, like foreign affairs like
imperial trade,
we can, we can regulate anything, we can
regulate everything.
You can't sort of, draw lines and say
well, the central government can do only
some things and, and other things have to
be reserved to the individual colonies.
Well they commonly thought somehow you
could try to codify, constitutionalize
if you will, the working arrangement that
had existed before the 1760's.
The Empire,
the Parliament will deal with certain
central matters and other things should be
reserved to the individual colonies they.
They tried to sort of propose a
constitutionalization, a codification of
that working understanding and the Brits
said no Parliament must be supreme in all
cases whatsoever.
And take it or leave it.
And the American Revolution
there we said, in that case, we decide to
leave it.
Now the Articles of Confederation soon
emerged.
How are these individual colonies going to
arrange matters among
themselves, because you're going to need
some central coordination for war
and foreign affairs and all the rest but
on the
other hand the colonies, individually,
want to retain certain powers.
So, so how are going to constitutionalize
federalism after the independence?
And what happens is Articles of
Conferderation emerge.
And the central government, Congress, are
given certain powers, basically of,
of, of treaty making and war and peace,
directing common defense, and
almost everything else is reserved to the
states, and there's a, a
clause that says, everything that the
ederal government, that the central
government
does has to be expressly enumerated,
listed in the Articles of Confederation.
And everything else is reserved to the
states, each
of which retained its freedom and, and
sovereignty and, and
independence, except for those few things
that have been expressly
delegated to the central government and
here's now the dilemma.
Parliament was too strong and the
colonies revolted.
The Confederation Congress is too weak to
do all the things that need to be done.
So now the Constitution is going to come
along and try to rebalance the thing.
Try to get it just right.
And that re-balancing occurs, most
obviously in Article I, Section VIII,
listing the powers that Congress has.
now, the word express is not going to
expressly isn't going to appear
in Article I, Section VII so Congress is
going to have, not
only the listed powers but also certain
implied powers that,
that flow from a fair reading of, of, of
the listed powers.
So that word, express, isn't going to be
there.
It caused problems in the Articles of
Confederation.
So, let's look at that list of expressed
powers, Article I, Section
VIII.
And let's just kind of quickly start to
work through it.
And then in our next lecture, we'll
continue to, to work
through Article I, Section VIII, and the
rest of Article I.
Here's how it begins.
The Congress shall have power to lay
and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and
excises.
To pay the debts and provide for the
common
defense and general welfare of the United
States, okay.
So, right off the bat, Congress is
going to be
able to tax us up and down and sideways.
Taxes, yes, but not just taxes.
But duties and imposts and excises, we've
just fought recently an
anti-tax revolution, and now actually, the
constitution is proposing a pro-tax
regime.
What's up with that?
What's up with that is, this new congress
is representative.
Ordinary people are going to be able to
vote for it.
The America Revolution, the, the,
the, the rally cry wasn't no taxation
period.
No taxation exclamation point.
It was no taxation without representation.
Parliament didn't represent ordinary
Americans.
Colonists didn't get to vote for
Parliament,
so Parliament couldn't impose taxes on
ordinary colonists.
Revenue measures.
That was the idea of the American
Revolution.
Since Congr-, since Parliament doesn't
represent us, Parliament shouldn't tax us.
But now this
new Congress is going to represent us so
it does have legitimacy to impose taxes on
us.
Remember, the Articles Confederation,
excuse me, under the
Articles of Confederation, the Congress
didn't directly represent
individuals, only the states were
represented, qua states,
as states, so only the states could be
taxed.
And the problem is, they didn't pay.
When they were asked for money, they
didn't pay up.
Now,
individuals are going to be able to be
taxed, and when
they import goods through the customs
house, or in other ways.
And if the individual doesn't pay, then
the federal
government will be able to, to make that
individual pay.
That, that, that's a fight that the
Federal government can win.
It's legitimate because people are
represented.
So, in some ways, not the absolutist power
that Parliament
had to impose taxation without
representation, and not the
inadequate power under the Articles of
Confederation, really the
absence of a power to tax, but actually
now
a power to tax individuals by a genuinely
representative body.
And why do we need that?
The first sentence of the longest section
of the longest article tells us why.
We are going to, Congress is going to need
to have that power to, they can
collect taxes, impost, du-, du-, duties,
and excises.
Why?
To pay the debts and provide for the
common defense and general welfare of the
United States.
Notice the echo of the Preamble.
Common defense, general welfare.
Here's why you have to pay, because we are
actually going to need national security,
that's going to require an army, armies
need to be paid, they need to have bullets
and, and shoes and and supplies.
That's going to cost money, so and, and
you, you
Americans need to support a constitution,
the federalists argue,
you're going to be taxed under this
Constitution, but you're
going to be taxed by a representative body
for national security.
So in that first sentence of Article One,
we
see a continuation of some of the great
themes of,
of the Preamble of the Constitution as a
whole democracy and national security.
In our next lecture we'll work through the
rest
of Article I, Section VIII and indeed the
rest
of Article I, and see these great themes
of
national security and, and geography and
democracy playing out.
We'll also talk a little bit more about
slavery in Article I.
See you then.
