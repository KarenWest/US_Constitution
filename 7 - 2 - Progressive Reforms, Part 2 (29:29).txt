Welcome back.
We're in the middle of our discussion
about the Progressive era amendments,
and we're going to focus in particular on
the 16th, 17th and 19th Amendments.
The 16th amendment, the income tax
amendment, reaffirms the power
of the federal government to impose a tax
on income.
And I say reaffirm because, in my view the
federal government always had this power.
Remember the Constitution is basically a
pro-tax revolution enacted shortly after
the anti-tax revolution of 1776.
The Constitution is all about taxation
with representation.
The, the Declaration of Independence and
the American colonies oppose it said,
said the Declaration of Independence in
effect said, and the colonists at the
revolution said.
No taxation without representation.
And in the Constitution, article one
section eight is all
about taxation with representation and we
need taxation for various purposes.
Most dramatically national defense.
And the longest section of the constitu,
the longest article is article one.
And the longest section, the section
eight.
And section eight begins
by saying Congress shall have power to
basically tax you up
and down and sideways and pose taxes,
duties, imposts and excises.
How many ways can they basically say that
you're going to be taxed, but don't worry.
At least there's a reason why, maybe you
should worry.
But there's a reason why we need taxation
for national security, and it will be
legitmate.
because Congress will be representative.
And in my view, there was nothing about a
federal income
tax that was distinctively problematic.
And Abraham Lincoln thought the same
thing.
And during the Civil War he signs his name
to a law that imposes an income tax.
And it's a progressive income tax.
It taxes people who make who have more
income, at a higher rate.
And, and it exempts people who, who make
below a certain amount.
Those are the two basic
features of a progressive income tax.
A progressive income tax basically takes
proportionately more
from the people who are making more money.
By exempting people below a certain amount
and by having higher tax rates
proportionately for people who are higher
income earners.
So Lincoln signs an income tax a statute
in the middle of the Civil War, and it's
upheld by courts.
So many states had income taxes.
All of which were generally progressive.
But the Supreme Court at the end of the
19th
century did an about face and say income
taxes are unconstitutional.
And that's impart because the party of
Lincoln which begins as an anti-slavery
party, eventually because of becomes the
dominant
party the, the Democrats have discredit
themselves
because of slavery and succession.
Lincoln's dominant political party
attracts a
lot of, of money and other things.
So it was from kind of an anti-slavery
party to a,
a corporate party, the party of Lincoln
becomes the party of Grant.
Here comes the party of McKinley.
And in that era the supreme court by five
to four vote over an emphatic descent by
John Marshal Harlem.
The same guy who descents in the Plessey
vs Fergason case.
But over his emphatic descent he says.
This ruling is going to be a disaster for
the
country, but over his descent, five
justices will claim
an income tax unconstitutional because
it's quote, and in
their view, a direct tax, which would
requires state apportionment.
I'm not going to go into all the details
except to stay there.
But I don't buy it, a lot of
constitutional
scholars who have studied the matter don't
buy it.
A lot of tax experts who have studied the
matter carefully don't buy it.
The direct tax language of the
constitution was very
much bound up with all sorts of
compromises about slavery.
It was, there were ways camouflaging some
of the pro-slavery aspects of the
constitution by linking the the idea of
apportionment,
representation with taxation but direct
taxation.
As I said, I'm not going to go into all
the details except to say that I
don't think an income tax is an improper
direct tax within the meaning of the
Constitution.
A direct tax is something you simply can't
avoid at all.
A head tax, putting a tax of $10 on every
person.
You just can't avoid that, short of death.
That's a direct tax.
It's also called the
capitation, and one of the reasons the
framers tried to limit
direct taxes as they didn't want early
Congresses to be able
to in effect to prevent the importation
of, of of slaves
from abroad by, by taxing slave
importation or taxing slaves themselves.
And so, these, there, there were pro
slavery compromises
built into some of the language about
direct tax.
But even at the founding, I think it meant
something very narrow.
You can avoid an income tax, just don't
make income.
I'll live off of your savings and do other
things.
So, so and income tax is not a direct tax.
Maybe land taxes of a certain sort.
We'll also see in this direct taxes.
Direct taxes on, on pieces of real
property
but, but income tax, I think, at the
founding
was understood as a permissibly
transactional indirect tax.
It was perfectly okay.
And so thought Abraham Lincoln and his
generation and
the Court originally upheld it but then
invalidated it.
And then the American people basically
rose up against the Supreme Court.
Only four times in American history have
the American people
responded to a Supreme Court decision by
overturning it by amendment.
The 11th amendment
when the judiciary early on went too far
in expanding it's own powers.
And in a case called Chism vs Georgia and
that generated the 11th amendment.
Dred Scott went too far in a whole bunch
of
ways and the 14th amendment reputiated the
Dred Scott case.
The polished case, the income tax case, is
repudiated by the income tax amendment,
the 16th amendment.
And then there's going to be one more
later in our story.
So stay tuned
for that one.
Now members for both parties supported the
income tax amendment.
Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.
For the Republicans Woodrow Wil the
Democratic party was also on board.
So, amendments succeed when both parties
are in favor
of them, and that's what happened with the
16th amendment.
Which as I said in my earlier lecture, my
previous lecture, sort of laid the
foundations in some very important ways
for the, the modern redistributed estate.
Our, the income taxes have that we've had,
have
always at least in theory been progressive
redistributed income taxes.
In practice, one can, one can raise
questions.
The 17th amendment also adopted in the
the 1910s as was the, income tax.
The early 1910s income tax amendment
provides for the direct election of
Senators.
And you might wonder why would existing
Senators ever go for that?
Because remember, no amendment can pass
unless 2 3rds of the House and
2 3rds of the Senate and 3 quarters of the
States say yes.
So, why would existing Senators who are
basically picked by State Legislators just
ever
vote to change the rules, by which
Senators are picked?
And part of the answer is, by the time the
17th Amendment
comes along, a bunch of Senators are
already kind of directly elected.
There have been improvisations in the
founders' system.
These improvisations begin as early as the
1850s with the
famous Lincoln-Douglas debates in the wake
of the Dred Scott case.
In 1858, Abe Lincoln
wants to be US Senator from Illinois.
Stephen Douglas who's the current U.S.
Senator wants to be reelected and legally,
strictly speaking, they're go, the
Senators going to
be picked by the Illinois state
legislature.
But what Lincoln and Douglas do, what the
political parties did,
look first, the political parties
basically
say, before the state legislative
election.
The Democrats say we're going to nominate
Steven Douglas and the Republicans
say we're for Abe Lincoln for senate.
And they announce that before the state
legislative election.
Now the state legislative election kind of
becomes a referendum of
sorts on whether you're a Lincoln man or a
Douglas man.
If you're a Lincoln man vote Republican
for state legislature,
if you're a Douglas man, vote Democrat for
state legislation.
Now, it's not perfect, it's not a perfect
referendum.
Because there's some malapportionment and
gerrymandering
and not all districts are open
in the election, and there might be other
issues
that you care about other than Lincoln
versus Douglas.
So it's not perfect, but, but the election
in 1858 for state
legislature was kind of rough referendum
on whether you preferred Lincoln or
Douglas.
And in fact, Lincoln got slight, Lincoln's
supporters cast slightly more vote than
Douglas' supporters but not quite enough
to swing the election in his favor.
Later generations of Americans
will sort of further improvise toward a
direct election system.
In states that have, basically, like, wha,
where one party is
dominant the key becomes to election
becomes winning the party nomination.
And if the state uses a primary system to
pick its nominee well then the primary
becomes in effect the direct election.
And a bunch of states basically,
especially in the South where one party
stays, the Democratic party.
Was the dominant party in, in some
western, in some southern states.
And there were other one-party states in
the Midwest.
So primaries were a kind of direct
elections.
Oregon improvised a different system.
Oregon basically said, when you vote for
Congress, for a US Senator,
for a member of the House of
Representatives, for state legislature,
when you vote, we're going to put on the
ballot a non-binding question.
The non binding question is whom do you
prefer for the US Senate.
Okay, and there were different iterations
of it.
The first version like whom do you prefer
and then,
you know, we're going to ha, actually have
a second question.
State legislators have to either promise
to
support the winner of the beauty contest.
The beauty contest is who do you want for
U.S. Senator.
.
So you either, I'll if you're running for
State
Legislature your name appears on the
ballot and whether
you're Republican or Democrat on whether
you've taken the
pledge, I pledge to support the beauty
contest winner.
So if you pledge to support the beauty
contest winner, even if you're a democrat
if the republican is the beauty contest,
you're promising to vote republican for US
Senate.
So second version is, your name and
whether you've taken
the pledge.
And the later version is you're actually
required to honor your pledge.
Now what exactly that means, is that
constitutional?
But in any event by the time the
17th Amendment comes along a bunch of, of
Senators
are already kind of directly elected
through some version
of the Oregon Plan or through the primary
system.
In one-party states.
And the 17th Amendments adoption is
a great dem, democratizing moment that
will actually have
reverberations later on, it's going to,
for example, help make
it easier for the US Supreme Court much
later to
insist on one person, one vote, for state
legislative elections.
Why?
Because when state legislatures picked US
Senators remember,
state legislatures might be kind of
mal-apportioned and that mal-apportionment
would be the basis for the US Senators
election and re-election.
So US Senators would have a stake
in state legislatures mal-apportionment
before the 17th Amendment.
It might make it hard for
justices to invalidate state legislative
malapportionment.
Because remember justices has to, have to
be confirmed by the Senate.
But with the 17th Amendment now US
Senators are
going to be left to one person one vote
state wide.
They don't have a particular
stake in state legislative
malapportionment anymore.
.
Think about how they 17th Amendment has
kind of transformed the presidency.
Before the 17th Amendment, members of the
House were directly elected.
Yes, they were more numerous, they were
less
prestigious Senators were smaller, more
elite, more prestigious.
But they weren't directly elected so.
Maybe a person from the house could say
you know, I'm
more of a populist politician than a
person from the Senate.
Well after the 17th Amendment, Senators
become every bit as populist as
House members but elected state wide for
six terms in this select body.
So no member before the 17th Amendment
various people went from the House of
Representatives to the Presidency without
having to
get a ticket punched in the Senate.
After the 17th
Amendment we haven't had any of those
types.
Who include people like James Madison, for
example, James K.
Polk.
But not since the 17th Amendment has a
mere House member and non-Senator
won the Presidency like Newt Gingrich or
Dick Gephardt, something like that.
17th Amendment has even changed how we
think about the Cabinet.
At the founding your state legislature
sends you to the
Senate, but they might prefer that you be
in the Cabinet.
You can deliver all sorts of goodies to
the state, so here's what they tell you.
Go to the Sen, go into the Cabinet and
we'll hold your seat.
And when you're done with your cabin
service you can
go back to, we'll give you your Senate
seat back.
Cabinet sandwiches, Senate to Cabinet back
and to Senate.
There were a bunch of those before the
17th Amendment.
That's not an easy deal you can strike
with the electorate at large, it doesn't
quite work.
So before the 17th Amendment lots of
cabinet sandwiches.
After the 17th Amendment no more cabinet
sandwiches.
People leave the senate to go into the
cabinet but they don't go back to the
Senate.
The way Benson Hillary Clinton, John
Kerry, and others.
They might leave the Senate to go to the
Cabinet, but
they don't count on going back to the, the
Senate anymore.
So the 17th Amendment has actually kind of
changed all sorts of other aspects of
government.
Senators used to be much more commonly
picked as Supreme Court justices.
Since this in recent decades, not so much.
Maybe that's because now US Senators have
to be much more
populist politicians than before when they
were sort of more elite statesmen.
Maybe their earlier job description was a
little
closer to what a Supreme Court justice
does and
their new job description is rather
different.
You have to be a populist politician and
maybe.
That's in slight tension with kind of
persona and
personality that makes for the best
Supreme Court Justice.
So the direct selectio of Senators has had
some all sorts of interesting indirect
effects if you will.
Over the Cabinet, over the presidential
elections, and over the scope of national
powers
as I argued earlier that, that, that
Senators are going to be
much more willing to vote for a
nationalist projects.
You're going to need a lot of money maybe
to run for the Senate.
So people who thought senators wasn't
going to
be a millionaires club anymore if we have
election.
Not so sure that they turned out to be
right.
But maybe the money is getting spread
around in democratic campaigns, rather
than in bribes, into
the pockets of state lawmakers.
For example old-style state legislators.
So, so the 17th Amendment has actually
reconfigured our
system, I think, in all sorts of
interesting ways.
But by far, the most important amendment
it seems
to me of the progressive era is the 19th
Amendment.
Direct excuse
me, the woman's suffrage amendment.
It's in fact a doubling of the franchise.
So now by the numbers may be the
most democratic even in all of American
history.
And now let's take a step back and try to
figure out how that happened.
because here's the real interesting thing.
Before women get the vote, only men are
voting.
And only men are going to, therefore, be
voting on whether women vote.
So how do women ever sort of bootstrap
themselves
into the vote, because they can't vote
themselves the vote.
They have to allow men to, to vote first
so how does that ever happen?
And the answer is gradually it takes 50
years for women basically to get
the vote from the Civil War era when black
men get the vote with the
15th Amendment and women are shut out and
they're, they're, very disappointed.
Takes 50 years from that for them to
finally prevail the 19th Amendment.
1920.
And as with
many constitutional reforms.
This one begins first in the states.
Federalism is an important part of our
story here.
National security is also going to come
into the story.
So it's going to be a story of democracy
and it's relationship to federalism and
national security.
Here is the federalism story.
Remember this was the great American
project, populating the West.
This epic
story of taking these this nearly virgin
soil
and creating civilized structures which
will eventually
and populating them and eventually
admitting these
regimes on equal footing with the older
states.
It was an amazing project and, and part of
that, in places like Wyoming.
Getting people to come to Wyoming and in
particular, getting women to come to
Wyoming, because in 1870, Wyoming
basically Wy, which is a territory, has
I think five white men for every white
woman, and they're desperate.
They want women to come.
And they're so desperate that they
actually start saying
well, maybe we should actually listen to
what women say.
Women say they want to vote.
So, we're going to let them, if they come
to Wyoming we'll let them vote.
And hey, they say they want equal pay for
equal work, we'll promise equal pay too.
So, Wyoming first promises this, in the
Wyoming territory.
And, and Wyoming and Utah and Idaho
and Colorado are the first states to
promise women the vote.
And the interesting thing is these are the
states where there aren't very many women.
And in a way, when you step back, it makes
sense because if men and women in a
jurisdiction are 50-50.
And you give women the vote and it turns
out to be
a mistake because remember, the rest of
the world isn't doing this yet.
So you're, you experiment, you give women
the
vote, and it's 50-50, then you can't undo
it.
But if you outnumber them five to one, you
give the the vote.
If it's a mistake, maybe you can take it
back.
Places where the men outnumber the women
are also
places where the men are most desperate to
get women
to come, immigrate and, and so supply and
demand meets
in a good place for women's suffrage in
those jurisdictions.
So it's a federalism story to some degree.
Men, the, the place, the irony is the
place where women get
the vote first is the place where there
are the fewest women.
And that's not true, Wyoming.
And that's not just true in America but in
the world.
The state where, the country
that first gives women the vote is New
Zealand.
Which is kind of the Wyoming of the, the
British Empire where men out number women.
In Australia, which also has kind of
territory, the federal system.
The places where women are fewest, western
Australia, the
kind of Wyoming of Australia, gives women
the vote earlier.
So this is a story that, that is true more
internationally.
But then here's the second part of it.
So some states experiment.
Federalism, laboratories of
experimentation.
And states are innovating here just as
states
first had Bills of Rights and written
constitutions
and three branches of government and
bicameral legislatures
and states are getting rid of slavery
first.
And, and so states are leading the way on
sorts of things.
States are putting constitutions to
special votes first, so
here's few states are giving women the
vote, and the
sky does not fall.
So the other states start to follow suit
eventually.
I'm saying well, if you're going to come
all
the way across the plains and over the
mountains.
You know, why stop in Wyoming?
Come all the way to California, you know?
Come to Oregon.
Come to Washington.
So other states start following suit at
the beginning of the 20th century.
By 1909, only only four states
with, only 2% of, of America's women.
Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming.
1909, only four states.
But by 1915-16, a whole bunch of states
have begun to join the bandwagon.
And now if you want to run for President
or US
Senator you have to be in favor of woman's
suffrage.
because if you're not in favor of woman's
suffrage you're conseding all of those
woman suffrage states.
So, one Senator from Ohio,he's opposed to
woman's suffrage, his
name is Atley Palmer and you've never
heard of him.
The other Ohio Senator who's in favor of
woman's suffrage, his name is Warren G.
Harding and he's going to get himself
elected present on those women's votes.
So, so once you see it start happening in
a bunch of other states you say if
you're a national politician that wants to
be president
and that means lots of votes in the
Senate.
Hey, I want to be in favor of that.
And once you
see different states voting, taking votes
on women's suffrage.
And women's suffrage losing 70-30 in the
first vote.
And the women keep pushing.
And then the next time when the suffrage
loses, now
remember, only the men are voting for it,
on, on it.
So it loses 70-30.
Then the next time three years later, they
get on
the ballot again in the state, and it
loses 60-40.
And then they get on the ballot yet again,
you know, three years later.
Because they're persistent,
these women suffragettes.
And then it only loses 55-45.
And now you think eventually they're
going to win.
And if they win, do I want to be the last
politician, standing in the school house
door, resisting women's suffrage.
because as soon as they win, they're
going to vote me out of office.
So I have to ge, pay attention, not just
to the men who
voted for me, but the women whom I might
need for my reelection.
And so, you go from only 2% of America's
women voting in 1909.
To 100% in 1920 once male politicians
think
that women are going to get the vote.
It becomes almost a self fulfilling
policy.
Then everyone kind of clampers on the band
wagon.
Want's to jump aboard it so that they're
not on the wrong side of politics and
history.
That's a Federalism story, it's a story
about political incentives.
It's also though the story of women's
suffrage and it's the story of women
[SOUND] being very emphatic and working
tirelessly
again and again and again to get this.
Women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
Susan B.
Anthony and their successors.
That is also the story of national
security.
because what else is happening in this
period, America is at war World War I.
And Woodrow Wilson initially opposes
women's suffrage.
He's a southerner, actually he pretends
he's a New Jersey person,
but he's born in Staunton, Virginia, he
grew up in, in Georgia.
People in Georgia don't like the 15th
Amendment
which guaranteed equal right, voting
rights for, blacks
so they don't want a 19th Amendment that's
basically going to be the same thing
except for sex.
More federal intrusion into state voting
regimes.
Southerners don't like that.
Wilson is a democrat.
He's a southerner.
That's the base of the democrat party,
he's inheriting
still Thomas Jefferson's party so
initially he's not in favor of it.
But then the women start shaming him.
They're chaining themselves to the White
House
gates and demanding rights for women,
saying.
You're in a war, and you say it's a war
for democracy.
And, and yet you don't let your own women
vote.
And we're part of the war effort.
Yes, we're not on the battlefield, but
we are providing the economic support that
helping
the war effort.
And a, and, so Wilson switches.
And here's one of the other reasons he
switches.
He believes that this war, stands for, is
about something and
eventually he wants it to be a war to end
all wars.
He wants to have a league of nations.
That will emerge after the war.
A league of nations in which the United
States is going to have to
be involved so these European countries
don't kill each other again you now,
and, and suck America in.
So the United States is going to have to
play a central role in
the League of Nations as sort of an
arbitor of old world disputes.
And he as president, Woodrow Wilson, will
be the leader of the free world.
That's a new, now job description of the
president.
Not just commander in chief and vetoer in
chief
and appointer in chief, but leader of the
free world.
And he's imagining that for himself.
And he's imagining that vision for the
United States.
But the United States will not be able to
lead a League of Nations, which is
going to be based on ideas and morals and
not just who has the most military might.
The United States will not have that moral
leadership,
and Wilson very much thinks of himself in
terms
of being a moral leader, won't have that
credibility
if we don't let, here in America, our
women vote.
Especially because, around the world,
other societies
are beginning to let their women vote.
So Woodrow Wilson
comes, personally, to the Senate of the
United States, dramatically.
Since Jefferson presidents basically had
only sent messages
to Congress, they didn't appear personally
before Congress.
But Wilson shatters that precedent and,
and goes,
and appears personally before the Congress
for various
things, and one of them is an appeal to
Congress to get them to to support
woman's suffrage amendment as a war
measure.
And he's explicit that this is as.
And now both parties eventually join on
board the Republican's and the Democrats.
Because if women's suffrage is going to
happen, you don't want the other
party to get the credit without your party
getting the credit too.
And Republicans say well, we're the party
of Lincoln and
we gave you the 15th Amendment so now
we're going to
do it again with the 19th, and the
Democrats say
we're the party of Woodrow Wilson and he's
in favor of
it, so we are too.
And you get the 19th Amendment and the
world will not be the same.
Women's suffrage I think transforms the
nature of women, women's politics today.
More women vote than men.
If women all voted for the same candidate,
they could basically decide every election
in the country, and if the men are close
to evenly divided, the women decide.
That's because of the transformative 19th
Amendment.
And I'm going to come back to that in well
let me
just tell you that's what this, this
depiction is all about.
Women crusading for women's vote, marching
in New York city.
I think this is a 1912 or so, I believe
they're marching down Broadway.
I"m going to come back to this at the very
end.
There are other amendments of the
Progressive era, the
18th Amendment gives you prohibition and
the 21st Amendment
takes it away sort of undoes it.
There's an amendment about
having the presidential term begin in
January, rather
than January 20th after the November
election rather than in March.
I'm going to say a little bit more about
that
amendment in my next pair of lectures.
Because that amendment was designed to
reduce the lame duck period.
Someone gets elected in November but they
have to
wait all the way til January before taking
office.
It turns out and before the 20th Amendment
they had to wait all the way' til March.
It turns out there's a way of having
the person who won the election, let's say
Romney had won the election against Obama,
having that person take office not in
January, but the day after the election.
Turns out there's a way to do that.
And that has to do with a later amendment,
a later 20th Century Amendment,
20th Century Amendment that we're going to
talk
about in next pair lectures, the 25th
Amendment.
so, we're going to talk about that in the
next set of lectures,
and we're also going to talk about another
generation of Americans that takes
to the streets.
The women are taking to the streets
to write a great historical wrong and
injustice.
If they've been excluded from a franchise
and that's not right.
And they take to the streets in the 1910s
and they prevail 50 years later.
Another half century later, a new
generation will arise.
Another generational spu, spurts of
amendments.
And this generation will once again take
to the streets to write some great
historic
injustices and wrongs.
And that's the story that we're going to
tell
among others in the next pair of lectures.
So stay tuned.
