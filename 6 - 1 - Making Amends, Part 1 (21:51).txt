Welcome back at this point, we've reached
a particular
interesting juncture in our guided tour of
the written Constitution.
We've talked about the Preamble.
How the constitution was ordained an
established by the people.
We've talked about Articles one, two and
three.
Vesting powers in the congress and a
president
and a judiciary that legislative executive
and judicial
powers respectively.
We've talked about Article four, which
outlines the significance of horizontal
federalism.
The relationship of states between amongst
themselves and,
and vis-a-vis the federal government and
the territories.
We've talked about articles five, six, and
seven which
showcase the idea of the supremacy of the
constitution.
How, amendments to the constitution
require
specially broad democratic consensus in
article five.
How the Constitution is the supreme land
of the land, notwithstanding anything that
the state
might say to the contrary, or Congress, or
the president, or federal courts for that
matter.
In Article six, and we've talked how
article seven
completes the project, mirroring and
echoing the preamble kind of,
bookends to the preamble.
Specifying the particular ways in which we
the people of the United States, via
special conventions, did, in fact, ordain,
and establish the constitution.
And in way, ways that we did so that
actually originally did not
involve all thirteen states saying, yes,
we do, but originally only eleven.
Nine would have sufficed for the
constitution to go
into effect.
Among those states so ratifying.
So, so that's where we are.
We've come to the end of the original
constitution
and now we're going to start talking about
the amendments.
And we reached, as I said, a particularly
interesting juncture because it
turns out that the amendments are tacked
onto the end of the document.
That didn't have to have been the case.
In many
state Constitutions, amendments are
basically woven into the earlier document.
They in effect, the earlier document is
word-processed, and you,
you get version 2.0 and 3.0 and it looks
just seamless.
But that's not how our constitution, the
federal
constitution that is has in fact been
amended.
Tha, that the textual amendments have just
been added to the end chronologically
as so many post scripts.
PS's, PP's, and
PP's like a careless written letter, a
critic actually once said.
But, but this is a reminder of one hugely
important truth about the Constitution.
That our Constitution is an
inter-generational project.
It's not merely the achievement of a group
of founders,
but actually, a group of founders and
amenders.
Later generations of Americans are
going to
add these texts of the Constitution.
And we're going to be able to see them the
contributions of these later generations,
with distinctive clarity, because it turns
out
the amendments were added sequentially and
chronologically.
So we've been talking a lot about the
founding era in the lectures thus far.
The lectures going forward are going to
carry us forward in time through a Bill of
Rights that actually arose in the founding
era, and a couple of other early
amendments.
And then a later spurt of amendments after
the Civil War.
Another burst of amendments at the
beginning of the 20th century.
A final burst of amendments at the, in the
middle and end of the 20th century.
So, so the juncture that we've reached
is one in which we're beginning to close
the book on, on the original
constitution, and open the book on the
world of constitutional amendment.
And this seems a good point so the,
to it reminds us of just the larger
Constitutional
project, before I start to talk about the,
the
early amendments, which we call the Bill
of Rights.
That phrase, in fact, is not in the
Constitution, and I'll tell you a little
bit about
the origins of this phrase, the Bill of
Rights.
But before I do, before I talk about
Amendments one to ten.
The first set of amendments which, in the
Constitution, in the written Constitution.
Start right after article seven.
But before I do that, let me just stop and
pause and, and say a word or two about
this extraordinary, inter-generational
constitutional project.
And, and, and its, its world historical a,
achievements and, and significance.
What have the American people, over the
course
of our history, actually given to the
world.
And I think we've given to the world some
extraordinary things,
hm, and, these things are part of a larger
inter-generational constitutional project.
The project in some sense, begins even
before
the Constitution with the achievement of
independence.
A declaration of independence, which let's
remember actually gave reasons
for breaking the ties that had bound the
colonists to the Mother Country.
So it was important that Americans
actually put down on paper their
justification.
They submitted
facts to a candid world about why they
felt impelled to
separate from King George.
Because of all the abuses that had been
perpetrated and how their petitions and
remonstrances had fallen on deaf ears.
Our revolution was organized around that
ideas and principles, it stood for
something.
You, you know, we hold
these truths to be self-evident.
And, and certain principles were, were put
forward.
And those principles weren't always
understood expansively
and all men are created equal, those
words.
Were penned by a slave holder who doesn't
free his slaves at his death, Thomas
Jefferson.
Yet, those words would grow over time
inter-generationally.
Lincoln's generation would give those
words a deeper and richer meaning
than the founders did.
And those words will continue to grow and
expand over the course
of American constitutional history, and
that's
what we're going to be talking about.
How the words from early eras do get built
upon by later generations.
But, the American revolution was
a successful military revolution that was
organized around ideas.
It does not, even though many people in
America are opposed to independence.
This successful colonial revolution does
not end in a blood bath.
In the streets with people slitting each
others throats
in civil society the way the French
Revolution does.
It, it doesn't end with, with, with a kind
of despotism that one sees with the later
Russian
revolution, Chinese revolution.
As revolutions go military revolutions its
a successful colonial revolution its
rather admirable
its not completely bloodless its not
velvet there had to be a war.
Its not quite like the Czech Velvet
Revolution in the late twentieth century.
But its pretty impressive, folks who
opposed the Revolution are not
guillotined.
They're, they're kind of voted
off the island, they're politically
ostracized, but still pretty impressive.
There's a military leader who emerges,
George Washington,
and he gives up military power, he
surrenders it.
That's not true in most revolutions.
These military figures actually hold onto
power forever, thee Fidel Castro's, and
Ho Chi Minh's, and Mao, Tse Tung's and,
and, and
Lenin.
So, so, in the history of the world,
these, Napoleon.
The American revolution is, is pretty
impressive, it seems to me.
It's about ideas.
And, and, and the dissenters are, are,
ostracized, to some extent, the, the
loyalist.
But, but, not guillotined, as will happen
in the French Revolution.
And this leads to a constitution.
So that's the first big kind of American
project.
Modeling for the world, a successful
colonial
revolution, that doesn't spiral out of
control.
And it leads to and, and the Revolution is
a kind of negation,
saying no to something.
We, we've cast off the English, though.
We reject that.
But then we have to build something, build
something presumably better.
To lay the foundations of, of, of
a new government that will protect
unalienable rights.
That's the project, says the Declaration
of Independence.
It's the right and the duty of a people
when they confront a tyrant to throw
off the tyranny and erect new governments
to
alter and abolish their system to make it
better.
And the first iteration.
The first round of, of great
constitutional reform, very
exciting constitutional reform in America
is at the state level.
A bunch of state constitutions emerging in
1776 and then, and thereafter.
And trying out different ideas and there's
some
experimentation, and some state projects
work, and others don't.
The Massachusetts constitution for example
in 1780 is put before
the electorate and they say, yes modeling
what will become a federal
practice in 1788 of getting the entire
continent to vote on a constitution.
So the first round is state constitutions,
and a lot of them
are written, and they have Bills of Rights
or Declarations of Rights.
And they map the powers of government and
they try to
delimit the powers of government.
And, and in some of them.
Some of these state constitutions worked
fairly well others less so.
And there's a period of a democratic
experimentation and then,
the U.S. Constitution comes along and
tries to
build on the best practices of the state
constitutions.
Massachusetts put its Constitutions to a
vote.
That was a good idea, we'll do the same.
Most states have three branches of
government, we'll follow that model.
Most states have bicameral legislatures,
not Pennsylvania, we'll follow that model.
Pennsylvania pays its lawmakers, that's a
good idea.
We'll do the same thing.
Pennsylvania, New York provide for a
census,
so that when people move around the,
the size of the, and shape of the
legislature changes.
We should do the same thing.
Massachusetts has a strong executive
branch.
We think that's a good idea, we'll follow
its example on that.
And, and New York too, and so on.
So, the framers are borrowing some of the
best practices that have emerged
from State Constitutions and that's the
next
great step in this epic Constitutional
project.
Giving the world and example
of a continental democracy.
Voted on up and down the continent by
people I've chance to participate.
I argued in the early lectures that was
the hinge of human history, it was
extraordinary.
And that conversation that the Americans
had
up and down the continent is going to lead
to future reforms like the Bill of Rights
which were going to talk about very soon.
So out of that conversation come
additional good ideas and new idea
when you get people talking to each other
up and down the continent.
But we are not done this inter generation
project is only getting started
it needs to secure it, its the, this new
fledgling nation.
It's, it's security and, and geostrategic
independence, and, and this
is going to ultimately mean that Louisiana
is going to be the, the territory,
is going to be acquired from France.
You kick kind of the old [UNKNOWN] regime,
the old monarchies out of the new world.
The most the most important constitutional
decisions
in America haven't always been court
cases.
They, they involve presidential actions
like Jefferson acquiring Louisiana.
Marberry versus Madison is the same year
1803.
But I don't think it's
the most important constitutional decision
of all time.
It's not even the most important
constitutional decision of 1803.
It's the Louisiana Purchase.
Remember Marbury versus Madison says
courts can strike
down acts of congress that they think are
unconstitutional.
But courts don't do that very often.
That's the only time John Marshall does
it, that's the only
time, actually, judicial review actually
occurs at the Supreme Court level.
of, vis-a-vis an act of Congress for the
entire Antebellum period,
actually from the entire period before
1850.
and, and so judicial review is going to
become important
later on, but Marbury in context isn't so
important.
It's the Louisiana Purchase.
Which doubles the size of the United
States
and, and now here's the next big
constitutional project.
Taking all this virgin territory and
turning
these territories into republican states
that will
be admitted on equal footing, on equal
terms with the old states.
We're not going to colonize over these,
these
new lands, and that's an extraordinary
project.
So if an anti-colonial project.
We're going to take an entire continent,
eventually
and basically working our way from the
eastern sea board and work our way all the
way to the pacific ocean.
Take these territories and eventually
turn them into states.
It's a great, epic project.
It can be criticized.
There are losers in this project, the
Native Americans are the big losers
in this project of Manifest Destiny and
the Monroe Doctrine.
But we create at the end of this, and it's
an epic constitutional achievement, and it
takes time to do, we create a continental
republic of equal states.
Where no state gets to lord over other
states.
Lincoln's project, you will recall, is
unifying the nation not just North
and South, resisting unilateral secession
but
East and West through a transcontinental
railroad.
It's an epic constitutional project, it
will succeed in creating a great
superpower.
The next great constitutional project,
ending slavery.
Remember the framers comprised
with slavery they created a house divided.
They were lucky, we were just lucky that
this western territory wasn't all slavery.
It could have been.
Nothing in the Constitution prevented
that.
Fortunately the Indians were defeated in
the north
in Ohio before they were and early on.
And so lots of, of settlement
occurred actually in the northwest.
Before it occurred in the south west, and
the path of expansion
didn't result in all the territories being
slave territories, as might have happened.
And then, boy, American history would be
very different, but it, but it
didn't quite happen that way, and but it
was still a house divided.
It wasn't all slavery, but it wasn't all
free
this western land, and eventually a war
will come.
We're going to talk about that a lot in
later lectures.
Because slavery in the territories was
just sort of left an, an open question.
But the next great constitutional project
and
again, remember, we're kind of beginning
to carry
the story forward in time, so this is a, a
preview of, of coming attractions.
The next great constitutional project
would
be ending slavery, Lincoln's
constitutional project affirming
the equal rights of black Americans.
Their civil rights and eventually their
political rights, their equal voting
rights.
Preserving liberty not just against the
central government, but against the
states.
That's going to be a great reconstruction
project
and, and all these promises are made.
They're not fully lived out until really
later in the 20th and
early 21st Century, but it's an amazing
Constitutional example for the world.
Imagine how different the world would look
if America hadn't ended slavery.
And then Hitler comes along with his
principles of Arian supremacy
and, and he intro, reintroduces slavery
into the continent of Europe.
And that might have succeeded had America
still been a slave-holding society
or a society committed to the supremacy of
one race over another.
But America wasn't that by
the time Hitler comes along.
America is an anti-slavery society by the
time Hitler comes along.
Committed to a principle of racial
equality.
It's not living it out fully yet, but it's
committed to that principal.
That idea that all men are created equal
has now been, in effect, written into the
Constitution.
And not just the Declaration of
Independence.
Now it's part of the supreme law of the
land.
And it means something far more robust.
And we're still not done with that
American constitutional project,
because of America's military might.
And its principles begun in the
Declaration of Independence and built
upon.
America in the Twentieth Century will
defeat Naziism, and Italian fascism,
and Japanese military aggressive
Imperialistic authoritarianism.
And a cold war will emerge after that.
And, and our
vision will basically thwart, Soviet
communism.
and, in the process, we will begin to
rebuild the world in our image.
A martial plan rebuilding Western Europe.
Taking Japan and, and rebuilding it as a,
as a more tolerant, democratic, open
society, and Germany too.
It's an extraordinary Constitutional
project made powerful
by the geostrategic might of the United
States.
By, by Lincoln's vision to unify the
nation north and south, and
east and west, and stand fast on the idea
that slavery is wrong.
And must end and ultimately, the deep
principle is that all men are created
equal.
But, but think about how many societies in
the history of
the world have ever sort of, I think, done
as much as,
as the United States has, from the
Declaration to the present
moment, and let me say one other thing
about the present moment.
In our lifetime, we are genuinely living
out the this idea of a multicultural,
multi-religious, multilingual society
where everyone really is created equal.
We're beginning to really, not just
redeem, the, the, the, the promise of
these later constitutional amendments that
promise equality.
Barack Obama is president of the United
States.
Pretty striking.
People of all faiths are eligible to run
for office, even
the highest office in the land and people
of no faith.
it's, it's, it's open to all, low-born
people, high-born people.
Great cities like New York and, and San
Francisco are places, really, where North
meets South and East meets West.
Where people from all the world from Asia
from
Africa from northern Europe from southern
Europe are coming together.
In this new world and modeling I think for
the rest of the world, an
example of genuinely democratic
pluralistic multicultural society.
It began with the Declaration of
Independence.
It traveled through the Constitution, and
the War of 1812, a sort
of re, re-secured independence and the
Louisiana Purchase.
And, and the, the democratization of and
Republicanization of, of the west.
Ending of, of slavery, the the, the
rebuilding of the House divided.
the,
extraordinary world, achievements, of
America in
World War Two, and the Cold War.
Basically vindicating our fundamental
values against those of, of intolerance,
and repression, and the [UNKNOWN] regime
and, and that story continues.
So, to conclude this lecture, and then
we'll start talking about the amendments.
The amendments are reminded that our
constitutional project does not end in
1789.
It's an intergenerational project.
The project actually is ongoing today.
The Big Bang, of, of you, if you will, of
the founding which
created this amazing reverberation to
certain
democratic momentum for America in the
world.
We're still feeling
all of that.
And what we're going to do for the rest of
this segment of the course, as we
work through the rest of the Constitution
after
Article seven is, carry our story forward
in time.
Through a Bill of Rights, through
the Jeffersonian era and then Lincoln's
generation.
And then that, that progressive area of
the twentieth, of the early twentieth
century.
The 1960's amendments, the second
reconstruction, and
up to the present.
so, stay tuned.
