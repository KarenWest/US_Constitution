Let's talk in a little more detail about
six particular texts that are central
elements of what I've been calling
America's symbolic Constitution.
The claim is not that they are in every
way exactly like the written Constitution.
The written Constitution is unique, it's
special, it towers
above everything else, and where it is
clear, it trumps.
But where there's ambiguity in the written
Constitution, these other
texts come in, I argue, to help take up
the slack.
To fill in the gaps.
Take the Declaration of Independence.
It says very famously that there, that
there should be no taxation without
representation.
That's one of the reasons that we were
revolting
from England is that Parliament and the
King have
conspired to try to impose all sorts of
taxes on Americans,
and Americans, the colonists haven't voted
for any of these things.
They're being taxed without
representation.
Now that idea helps us understand, yet
again
for example, the rightness of McCulloch vs
Maryland.
On one of the questions in the case,
remember?
One of the question is.
Once the federal government has set up a
national
bank, are states allowed to impose
discriminatory tax on that bank?
And Marshall says, no, there are not.
And you might say, but Professor, you
don't need a
Declaration of Independence for that,
you've to the Constitution's Supremacy
Clause.
But Marshall doesn't rely solely on the
Supremacy Clause of the Constitution
that says federal law trumps state law,
and here's one reason why.
The federal law in McCulloch
creating the bank, did not in so many
words explicitly say that banks can not
tax it.
So, if the federal law had said that,
then it would have been a simple, easy
supremacy
case, but, but, the law didn't quite say
that
so, it was a little less clear cut
textually.
But now some structural principles come in
and Marshall says here is
a structural principle, when Maryland is
imposing a tax on that bank it's
basically, that national bank that was
created by the people of all the States.
Maryland is in effect imposing a tax on
Virginians who supported the bank and New
Yorkers and, and Connecticut residents and
Rhode Islanders
and that's, in effect, improper taxation
without representation.
Maryland can impose tax on its own
constituents, but it shouldn't oppose a
tax on
out-of-staters, and a kind of implicit
appeal,
to this Declaration of Independence idea,
which is
very central of them in McCulloch when you
read it.
That its one thing to impose a tax on
people who vote for you, and if they don't
like the tax, they can vote the bums out,
its very different to impose a tax on
unrepresented persons.
Take another area of law that, that some
justices, Justices Scalia and Thomas
have, have raised and eyebrow about is
called the Dormant Commerce Clause.
And here's how it works.
There is the so called commerce clause in
Article I, Section VIII, and
this says Congress has power to
regulate commerce among the states,
interstate commerce.
Fine.
But the courts have construed the
Constitution, as a
whole, to say that even where Congress has
not
passed a law, even where Congress has been
silent,
has been dormant, has been sleeping, so to
speak,
there are certain things that states can't
do that interfere with an integrated
national economy.
States state A for example, let's say New
York can't impose special and
discriminatory taxes on soft drinks
that are imported from Connecticut or New
Jersey from out of State.
New York can't impose also sorts of
burdens on out-of-staters
in all sorts of ways, and can't
discriminate out-of-staters in, in various
ways, even if Congress hasn't spoken, even
if Congress has been silent, dormant.
The Constitution itself as a whole is
construed
to prevent certain kinds of state
discrimination against out-of-staters.
You might say well, how did they make that
up?
One thing is even that, that Congress has,
I think pretty clearly encourage the court
to do this.
And, and Congress, if the court tried to
get out of that business tomorrow,
Congress would
pass a statute saying saying, no, we want
you to keep doing what you're doing,
because
we can't pass a statute anticipating every
single
way in which every single state might
interfere
with an integrated national economy, but
we want
you to keep doing what you were doing.
And if we didn't like what you had been
doing, we could have easily changed it,
and we didn't.
But here's a different
argument for the Dormant Commerce Clause.
That it's an implementation of this idea
of no taxation without representation.
New York can impose all sorts
of disadvantages and impositions and
obligations on
his own citizens because they're
represented,
but it really shouldn't be doing that
to the people of New Jersey, or
Connecticut or what have you because
that's, in effect, a violation of this
declaration idea of no taxation with,
without representation.
An idea that you see as a in iconic cases
like McCulloch v.
Maryland.
Let's take the Federalist Papers.
They I think, were a reminder that we have
to read the Constitution as
a whole, because the Federalist Papers are
meditation on the Constitution as a whole.
The Federalist Papers, the ones that were
most influential, actually, were the early
Federalist Papers that reminded us that we
created a Constitution for national
security, geostrategic reasons.
Now, this, I think, can be deduced from
the text of
the Preamble which talks about a more
perfect union in common
defense, from the language of Article I,
Section 8 that talks
again about common defense right at the
very beginning as being important.
So, we see these traces in the text, but
to
the, in the text, but to the extent that
there's any
ambiguity about that, the Federalist
Papers
kind of come in and supplement that.
And it's the early Federalist Papers that
are the most
important, way before you even get to the
Federalist number ten.
They basically say, we're forming an
indissoluble union, and
we're forming it for geostrategic, and
national security reasons.
And that's the central point of the
Constitution.
And a case like McCullough v.
Maryland is going to come along and say,
that's actually why
you can have a national bank, because a
national bank is useful
for national security purposes.
It's useful to help pay the army on site,
and on time.
so, so the Federalist Papers here help
confirm to the extent there's any
ambiguity, the centrality of national
defense,
common defense as a key constitutional
purpose.
Let's take the Northwest Ordinance.
This is one that you haven't perhaps been
as familiar with.
This was a,
an, a resolution passed by the, under the
Articles of Confederation in 1787.
It was enacted at the very moment that the
Philadelphia framers were coming up with
the constitutional plan.
And the Northwest Ordinance was a plan for
how the states north of the Ohio River,
or the territory north of the Ohio River
what eventually be turned into states and
admitted into
the Union.
Any states would later become Michigan,
Ohio, Illinois,
Indiana some parts of Wisconsin, some
parts of Minnesota.
And
as soon as the Constitution was adopted
the first Congress, in one
of its very first statues, they said we
endorse the Northwest Ordinance.
We now make it a federal statute, because
it had been passed under the Articles of
Federation, but we approve it and this
basically
was a blueprint for the rest of westward
expansion.
Territories loomed very large in the early
republic.
The early republic of the United States
wasn't just states.
It was states and territories and the
District of Columbia.
And Northwest Ordinance is a blueprint for
how the states are going to be organized
and it's a kind of proto-Constitution for
the people of the Northwest.
it's, it's a, a, a huge chain in the link
connecting the
biggest project of the entire early
republic, which is
taming the west, turning the west into a
series
of, of, of democratic republican
governments that are going to
be admitted on equal terms with the other
states.
That's, the biggest basically project
before the Civil War.
And the Northwest Ordinance, basically, is
an early blueprint for that.
And it links that project
up with what will become the next great
project, which is ending slavery.
because, as I mentioned before, the
Northwest Ordinance
actually says, no slavery in, in the
Northwest.
Also now, why would that matter today,
because we have the 13th Amendment,
professor.
Well, the Northwest Ordinance says that
these states should not
be, from the West, should not be treated
as colonies.
We shouldn't, on the East coast, try to
lord over our
Western neighbors the same way that the
Brits tried to lord
over us.
These states should be these territories
should become states.
The states should be admitted to the Union
on an equal footing,
on sort of equal terms, roughly speaking,
with the, with the earlier states.
That's a deep Constitutional principle
even if unwritten.
And it's, and it's celebrated by the
Northwest
Ordinance and here's what it means for
example.
That if one day Puerto Rico
has a very clean referendum saying we want
to by, that a clean majority
vote, we want to be a state we don't
want to be a kind of dependency anymore.
Nothing in the written Constitution
actually requires that the rest of us say,
okay, we're going to admit you as a state,
or let you go free.
And the written Constitution might permit,
if you read
it, you know, strictly, America as a
colonizing colonial power.
But the unwritten
Constitution, the Northwest Ordinance is
saying no, that's wrong.
That's not what we're about.
In our DNA is the idea that actually, we
should not lord over other people.
So if the people in Puerto Rico really
want to be independent
I'm sorry, seem to want to be a state
here's our choice.
Admit them as a state, along with all the
other states on equal terms or cut em
loose.
That's our choice.
We can decide whether we want them but,
but we
can't lord over them indefinitely if they
don't like that status.
If they are comfortable with it, that is a
different thing that's with consent.
But the Northwest Ordinance might help us
think
through important issues going forward in
a way that,
what, the Constitution's text might be
ambiguous, the
Northwest Ordinance and its anti-colonial
idea is more clear.
So I've told you a little bit about the
Declaration of Independence, a little
bit about the Federalist Papers and what
it might mean today, some, some
applications on,
on national security, the Northwest
Ordinance.
Let's take Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
The theme of this address.
There are many themes, but one of them is
all about sort of life and death.
He's at a graveyard a cemetery.
He's presiding over a certain
commemoration, memorial ceremony.
Bodies are being put in the ground.
And he is talking about how out of this
death and destruction there, we
the living have to rededicate ourselves
and
find meaning, find new purpose.
We, the living, need to experience what
Lincoln will call a new birth of freedom.
He begins with the, the birth of imagery
see.
Four score and seven years ago our fathers
brought forth on the, brought forth
like we're bringing forth a baby, on this
continent a new nation conceived.
Birth image, in liberty and dedicated to
the proposition
that all men are created equal.
We were born as a nation, committed to a,
a certain idea of equality.
And then at the end, he says we must have
a new birth of freedom amidst all this
death and destruction.
A new birth of freedom.
And the 14th Amendment is going to play
off of those words.
It's going to begin this, this new birth
of freedom.
With freedom at birth, everyone born in
America, that key word is born a citizen.
Born a free citizen.
Born a free and equal citizen.
So I think when you read that first
sentence
of the 14th Amendment through the lens of
the, of
the prism of the Gettysburg Address, you
see the significance
of a certain word that otherwise you just
might miss.
This idea of born.
We're born equal.
This is Lincoln's gloss
on Jefferson's idea that we're created
equal.
So what does that birth equality mean?
It means the 14th Amendment means just
what its text says.
It's not limited to race.
They could have said race.
They say it in the 15th Amendment but this
says we're generally, we're born equal.
We're born equal male and female, Jew and
gentile, black and white.
A deep idea that your status should not
depend on, on the conditions of your
birth.
A so if your born third in the family you
shouldn't have
lower inheritance writes than if your born
first in the family, no primogeniture.
By the way that's a principle the
Northwest Ordinances too.
And Lincoln grows up in the Northwest.
That's, that's, that's his, his, school
teacher in effect.
Is the Northwest Ordinance.
His mother's milk the Northwest Ordinance.
So, we are born equal.
And that idea which you can see
textualized in the 14th
Amendment is a meditation, is a reflection
of Lincoln's Gettysburg address.
Lincoln's vision is being
constitutionalized
and textualized in the 13th,
14th, and 15th Amendments, and if you
want to understand the full
significance of those written texts, you
need to see them,
read them, through the prism of what
Lincoln has been saying
He dies and the nation experiences this
new birth of freedom.
I'm going to come back to that picture of
Lincoln at the very end of this
lecture as, as we always come back to the
pictures at the end of chapters.
But before I do, let me just say a couple
of words about Brown v.
Board of Education and the I have a dream
speech,
both of which try to, to carry forward
Lincoln's vision, and
do so in very interesting and distinctive
ways.
Brown, of course, is a meditation on that
idea of equality, of birth equality.
Particularly with reference to racial
equality, that we're born equal,
black and white, and the government should
not be in the
business of saying whites are born above
blacks, that they should
be, that they are born lords and blacks
are born surfs.
That's Brown vs.
Board of Education's meditation on
Lincoln's, idea.
But even once you say, okay, the
Constitution
says equal, the written Constitution, and
separate really isn't
equal, the government shouldn't be in the
business
of separating the races in order to create
inequality.
And you can say, but if you say the 14th
Amendment is pretty clear about that.
What about the
further question whether of the government
has an affirmative duty or government
should in some way be encouraged, not
nearly to avoid racial segregation
and separation by law, but what about the
idea that the government
actually should affirmatively encourage
integration of
the races bringing together the different
races.
Does the
14th Amendment require that or, or
encourage
government to go that far, to, to say
integration as opposed to mere
desegregation, but affirmative integration
is, is actually a special constitutional
value.
I'm not sure the 14th Amendment's words
say that.
I think there's some real different
possible interpretation here.
We, we come again to the idea
that sometimes the written Constitution is
quite ambiguous.
It says equal but I'm not sure it really
says integration in a strong way.
And separate can in some spheres in fact
even be equal.
This of sex segregation in, in sports
teams
and locker rooms, and gym classes, and so
on.
So separate, in theory, can be equal
sometimes.
And even if
the government should be in the separation
business.
Sh-, sh-, we want to go further, say
government should be actually, in the
integration business.
I'm not sure the 14th Amendment is so
clear.
The 15th Amendment does say that blacks
and whites are going to vote and vote
equally, and therefore be in the same room
when they're voting in a legislature.
Or they are going to be deliberating
together in a jury bo-, in a jury
room or sitting together in a jury box,
but,
but those arguably are more modest spaces
of integration.
That's not the entire world.
That's the Legislature.
That's the, the, the jury deliberation
room.
That's the jury box.
But once we understand that Dr. King's
speech is an important element of our
symbolic constitution, I think we do see a
little bit of a, of, of the pull of a
more affirmatively integrationist vision,
more affirmatively integrationist frankly
than anything in the written Constitution,
strictly read.
On that day, Dr. King ends by summoning up
a vision.
His dream.
His dream is of black boys and white boys,
children black girls and white girls, all
of God's children joining hands.
Touching each other, being together,
joining hands, integrated
and singing, iIn the words of the old
negro spiritual, free at last, free at
last,
thank God Almighty, we are free at last.
And it's not merely that's his vision, his
words are integrationistic.
the, the, the, the optics are
integrationistic too.
That's a day in which Americans of, of
different races are actually coming
together in DC to, to call for civil
rights and voting rights.
America is witnessing, as King is speaking
an integrationist moment.
A joining of hands across the racial
divide.
A vision not merely of liberty and
equality,
but a vision of actually of genuine
fraternity.
Of, of, of racial
integration and solidarity.
Far more explicit, I think, and more vivid
than probably anything in the written
Constitution, but an important element of
today's unwritten Constitution, of
our constitutional culture surrounding the
terse text.
Okay, so just in conclusion, back to
Lincoln.
This picture of Lincoln is taken just
weeks before
he delivers the, Gettysburg Address.
It's 150 years ago.
It's November 1863.
So, almost exactly 150 years ago this
season.
And
I just want to step back and, and suggest
that although we talk a lot about the
founders.
We talk about James Madison as father of
the Constitution.
We talk about Thomas Jefferson who wrote
the Declaration of Independence.
They were slaveholders.
They died as slaveholders.
They did not free their slaves at their
death unlike Washington, who tried to take
steps in
that direction.
Jefferson and Madison found a political
party that's based
basically on slavery, gets its votes on
the southern side.
That's where their political bread is
buttered.
Their party will become, the party of
Jackson, Andrew Jackson.
The party of Roger Taney and Dred Scott
will drive
America over a cliff because of of its
pro-slavery tendencies,
and, and the system will almost die as a
result of that.
Call that near-death experience the Civil
War and in it's ashes it is reborn.
American experiences a new birth of
freedom thanks to
this man, Lincoln, who generously gives
the credit to Jefferson.
He says that he's just you know building
on Jefferson's idea that all
men are created equal, but, but Jefferson
never walked the walk really as
President or ex-President.
Maybe he talked the talk Jefferson is a
complex character, but what you need to
understand is that our Constitution today
isn't really James Madison's.
Isn't really Thomas Jefferson's.
Their Constitution failed.
We today, my fellow Americans, live in
Lincoln's constitution.
There was a House.
It was divided against itself
because of slavery.
It fell because of slavery.
It was rebuilt.
We call that rebuilding, The
Reconstruction.
It was a new birth of freedom,
superintended by Lincoln.
He lives to see the 13th Amendment
proposed, but not ratified.
After his death, a 14th Amendment codifies
his
vision that we're all born equal, created
equal.
A 15th Amendment constitutionalizes
almost his last wish.
In his last public address he actually
says, you know, I think that blacks should
actually have voting rights equally with
whites in, in, in many situations.
He had said that publicly before, he had
believed it, he,
he had grown, he had evolved over the
course of his presidency.
This was not a position he had early on,
but this was
one that he came to and he shared with an
audience two
days before his assassination, maybe three
days before his assassination, and the
15th Amendment codifies that vision, and
the 14th Amendment codifies that vision.
We today, my fellow Americans, live in
Lincoln's house, a house where equality is
at the center not just racial equality,
but broader forms of equality, of birth
equality.
So even though sometimes we give the
credit
to Jefferson and Madison, as I said, I
think we really live in, in Lincoln's
house.
He the man.
Well Professor, you said all men are
created equal.
You said, he the man.
What about women?
What about women, indeed?
That's what we're going to talk about in
the next chapter, so stay tuned.
