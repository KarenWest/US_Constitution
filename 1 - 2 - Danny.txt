Hi, my name is Danny Townsend and I'm a
two L here at Yale Law School.
I'll be one of the TA's for
Professor Amar's Constitutional Law class
this semester.
Like Professor Amar, I first went to Yale
down the street at Yale College.
However, in between Yale College and Yale
Law School,
I was in China for a year studying Chinese
politics.
As an undergraduate, I also took Professor
Amar's Constitutional Law class.
One of the things I'm excited to see is
how this
class differs from the class that I took
as, here in College.
One of the most important additions I
think will be
Professor Amar's concept of the unwritten
Constitution, which is the
title of the book that he published in
between when
I was here at college and this class this
semester.
You'll be seeing me around this course in
the interactive segments
that we've designed with Professor Amar to
supplement the weekly lectures.
These interactive segments might range
from
a Google Hangout with students from around
the world to a special freeform discussion
between Professor Amar and a distinguished
guest.
As always, we're always
interested in your feedback, so if you
have ideas for a kind
of interactive segment that you'd like to
see, please let us know.
Hopefully I'll see you there.
