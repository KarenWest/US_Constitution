Welcome back.
We're in the middle of a conversation
about the longest
section of the longest article of the
Constitution, Article 1, Section
8, which catalogs, enumerates the powers
of Congress, the powers of
Congress mainly vis a vis the states,
addressing a Federalism question.
How much can the central government do?
How much should be left to the individual
state governments?
But also, in the process,
talking about certain powers that, within
the Federal government,
Congress is going to have vis a vis other
branches.
So there's some separation of powers as
well as Federalism
dimensions to article 1, section 8, that
we'll be talking about.
We began by talking about the first
sentence, a sentence that says Congress
is going to be able to tax us, up and down
and sideways.
Taxes, duties imposed, and excises.
Why?
In order to pay the debts of the United
States,
promote general welfare, and especially
provide for common defense.
So we're going to need to pay for national
security, And
the Articles of Confederation did not do a
good job of that.
States were supposed to pay into
continental coffers and they didn't do it.
And there was no money and the till.
The cupboard was bare.
And George Washington and others
understand that when the next war comes
around, if that cupboard is bare, America
is going to lose its independence.
He doesn't know when and how that next war
might arise.
But he knows Washington does, and his
allies, that America almost lost the
Revolutionary War.
It was they were very fortunate to have
all sorts of help
at key moments.
And they can't count on that again.
America's going to need to have the
resources for national security.
And that's going to require a government
that has
the power of taxation in order to be
legitimate.
That government, because it's going to be
taxing individuals, it's going to have to
be one in which individuals are
represented,
as they are in a house of representatives.
Okay, what's the next power?
Congress shall have power to borrow money
on
the credit of the United States.
Why do you need to borrow money?
You need to borrow money, in part, because
in a
war, when everything depends on it, you
might need to borrow.
And if you, and if people, and people
aren't going
to lend you money unless you can pay it
back.
And you can't pay it back unless
you actually have a revenue source like
taxation.
So you see, begin to see how these things
fit together.
The next power, the power to reg-,
Congress has power to regulate commerce
with
foreign nations, among the several states,
and with the Indian tribes.
This is basically a power of foreign
affairs.
It is a power to regulate trade with
foreign nations, and with Indian tribes.
But not just trade.
I think if you read commerce narrowly it
might suggest just trade.
But commerce can be read more broadly to
suggest all matters,
affairs, transactions.
So, does that mean that Congress can
regulate all matters, all affairs, all
transactions?
No.
All foreign affairs.
That is, affairs with foreign nations.
All Indian affairs.
Affairs with the Indian tribes.
All, interstate problems.
Affairs, matter stuff, among the several
states.
So this is not unlimited plenary power.
The idea
is that if something is
genuinely international, the federal
government should
handle it, not the individual states, if
it involves foreign nations.
If something is genuinely a matter of
Indian affairs, the federal government
should do that.
Because you don't want individual states
riling
up the Indians, who might then start
being in the way, not just with that state
but with the other states.
If something genuinely spills over across
state
lines, then that's the sort of thing where
the federal government should
regulate, because it's the government
where
people from all the states are
represented.
Now on, on this view of, of,
of the matter, again Congress' power isn't
unlimited.
The question is, is it really interstate
and inter, or international?,
Or, is it really, something that affects,
our relations with the Indians, our
affairs with the Indians?
If you had a narrower view, that commerce
just means trade, economic stuff, stuff
that travels
through markets, then, it's not clear
actually where
there is a foreign affairs power in the
Constitution.
It's not clear where there's power to
regulate navigation, which isn't itself,
narrowly, trade.
Immigration, people coming into the United
States.
If it's not in this clause I don't know
quite, where it is.
What about when people want to just travel
from one state
to another, maybe not to spend money, but
just to travel.
Shouldn't the federal government have
power to
regulate roadways and things like that,
that
really are about intercourse, interaction,
among, commerce,
in its broadest sense, among the states?
And early on, Congress actually does pass
a statute, a statute that
makes it a crime for Americans to rile up
the Indian tribes.
And that's, even in non-economic ways.
And if the commerce power is not the
source of that statute, I don't know what
is.
It's not merely a statute implementing
various treaties with the Indians.
It's a statute dealing with tribes
even with whom we have no treaties.
So again, Congress' power, in this view,
isn't unlimited and plenary.
It's limited, but the basic idea is if
something is
really international or interstate, if it
really spills over across a
state border or a federal or a national
border, that's when
you want the federal government, rather
than the individual states involved.
Congress has power
to establish a uniform rule of
naturalization, and that's
not about immigration narrowly, just
people coming to the United
States, say, to visit or something, but,
but the power
to actually make them citizens, citizens
of the United States.
That's the power given to the Federal
Government.
To pass uniform laws on the subject of,
of, bankruptcies.
So again to create kind of a, an, a, a
free trading
zone with people doing business across
state lines having some interstate rules
about debts debtors and creditors in a
continental free market.
So again this idea of things that might
spill over across state lines.
Congress has the power to coin money.
You may say well, gee, doesn't that follow
from just the power to regulate
interstate commerce, that commerce might
depend on a
common currency, like the Euro in Europe
today?
So perhaps some of the provisions of
Article
1, Section 8, perhaps didn't need to be
specified.
Maybe they were put in out of an abundance
of caution.
Some of them are also not just federalism
provisions, to make clear
that the federal government can, can do
this vis a vis the states.
But separation
of powers ideas within the federal
government.
This is up to the legislature and not the
executive.
In England, for example, the power to coin
money was a royal power, an executive
power.
And Article 1, Section 8, is making it
clear that in
America this is not given to the president
but to the Congress.
Of course, the President's going to be
part of the law-making process with the
veto.
We'll talk about that in later weeks.
So just some of the other powers that I
think fit into our
emerging story of, of national security
and geo-strategy, of, of power,
for example, to establish post offices,
again, to knit the country together
so that there can be correspondence north
and south and east and west.
A power to promote art and science by
things like copyright laws.
Again, you want to have uniform rules
about that
across the different states so that a book
published in one state, we know what the
rules are for reprinting it in other
states.
So we have kind of one common market with
one set of intellectual property rules.
A power to constitute tribunals inferior
to the Supreme Court.
Again, the separation of powers idea.
In America, Presidents can't courts
unilaterally.
The legislature is going to decide how
many
lower courts there shall be for, for
example.
That's again a separation of powers idea.
That here, that's not merely left to the
executive branch to decide, for example,
as it was in England, how many judges
there would be and the like.
Some big ones.
Powers to define and punish piracies and
felonies committed on
the high seas, and offenses against the
law of nations.
Again, consistent with this idea that the
federal government is
being created for, for foreign affairs and
national security purposes preeminently.
Congress has power to declare war.
And making clear that this is not a
unilateral
executive branch power, but Congress has
an important role.
Maybe certain wars might need to be fought
in the event of an imminent invasion or
something.
It doesn't say, to just to make war, it
says to declare war.
So maybe if fighting has already broken
out,
maybe the President has unilateral power
to repel invasions.
That has been our tradition.
But this power
to declare war is a congressional power,
not an executive power.
And of course, it's a federal power, and
not a state power.
We don't want individual states picking
fights with foreign nations, and deciding
whether
we're going to go to war against Germany
or France or Japan or whatever.
Some interesting provisions about armies
and navies, power
to raise and support an army, but no
appropriation of money to that use shall
be for a term, longer term than two years.
To provide and maintain a navy, to make
rules for the army and navy.
National security, power to have a
national army, a national navy.
But note the difference
between the army and the navy.
The army has to be reauthorized every two
years.
So, what's up with that?
But not the navy.
What's up with that?
It's a geo-strategic idea, that armies are
more threatening to domestic
liberty than navies, so armies have to be
reauthorized every two years.
Why every two years?
Because there's a House election every two
years.
So, although bicameralism doesn't
automatically mean you're
going to get fewer laws, sometimes you get
more
laws and log rolls and things like that.
Certain laws lapse.
They sunset every two years.
Army appropriations, every two years the
army appropriation goes down to zero.
It has to be affirmatively repassed by the
House as
well as the Senate, and then presented to
the President.
So, so, built into this is a certain bias
against,
our, an authorization of armies.
We might need them, but a concern that if
we need
them they have to be
continually reauthorized in any
congressional election.
If the people are tired of an army, they
just in effect vote no,
vote for members of the House of
Representatives who are opposed to an
army.
All the House of Representatives has to do
is do nothing at all.
And sometimes those legislators in
Congress, they're
very good at doing nothing at all.
But if they do nothing at all the army
lapses every two
years automatically.
Not the navy, but the army.
No standing appropriations for standing
armies.
A very interesting combination of sort of
democracy and, and geo-strategic national
security concerns.
Wrapping up much of, of what's gone before
is a general power.
And then there's some rules about
militias.
I'm going to talk about militias in just a
minute.
and, the relation between the federal army
and the, the local militias.
but, the, there's a power of Congress to
regulate a national
capital, so that its not dependent doesn't
have to be located in an individual state.
But the national government can have its
own capital city.
And the national, and Congress can pass
laws to regulate that capital city.
And then
at the very end of Article 1, Section 8,
the longest section of the first and
longest article, Is, sort of, a general,
catch-all sentence.
Congress shall have power to make all
laws, which shall be
necessary and proper for carrying into
execution the foregoing powers, and
all the other powers vested by the
Constitution in the government
of the United States, or in any department
or officer thereof.
At least two dimensions here.
There is a federalism dimension that, just
a reminder that not all the powers are
expressed and explicit.
There's some implicit power basically to
implement, to carry into execution,
the foregoing, the other powers that we've
just been talking about.
So there's a little, some play in the
joints.
It's a Federalism reminder that not
everything has to
be express and explicit in empowering the
new Congress,
as it did have to be express and explicit
in empowering the old Congress under the
Articles of Confederation.
So maybe one of the most important words
in the clause
that I just read to you is a word that's
not there.
Express, explicit.
That was pointedly omitted from
the sentence.
so, that's a Federalism idea.
Another Federalism idea is that federal
laws have to be proper.
so, no pretextual use of federal power.
So, for example,
could Congress use its power of copyrights
to punish newspapers it didn't like?
Say, well, only newspapers that support
the administration will get copyright
protection,
but not critics of the administration.
Use its power of taxation to go after
critics.
Only newspapers that oppose the
administration will be
taxed in a certain way when they try
to ship newspapers from one state to
another
or something, but but pro-administration
newspapers won't be taxed.
Well, I would argue that that's an
improper exercise of
Federal power, and it's a violation of the
necessary and
proper clause that Federal power has to,
be exercised
consistent with the letter and spirit of
the Constitution.
This was an issue that had arisen with
Britain.
Britain tried to leverage certain powers
that the colonists admitted it had, to
regulate trade within the empire, and with
other nations and empires.
Parliament tried to use that as a way of
raising
internal, raising revenue.
And the colonists said, no.
We can see you can regulate foreign
affairs for certain,
security purposes, but we think you're
misusing that power when
you try to do that to, to, raise money for
us.
That's a pretextual use of a power given
for other purposes.
And the necessary and proper clause is a
reminder that certain powers are given for
certain purposes.
And if they are used to do things that the
Federal government
really isn't supposed to be doing,
there is an argument that they're
unconstitutional.
So that's
the necessary and proper clause as a
matter of federalism.
As a matter of separation of powers, note
that the necessary and proper clause
really establishes that, in fact, Congress
is
first among equals, first among the three
branches.
It's mentioned first.
And it really, it has power to, to pass
laws, implementing, not just its own
powers, but also regulating, to some
extent, other powers vested by the
Constitution.
In the government of the United States, or
in any department or office or thereof.
It's Congress that decides, for example,
how many
cabinet officers there'll be and how to
sort of
divide things up among the cabinet
officers, and how
much the cabinet officers are going to be
paid.
It's Congress that decides how many courts
there will be below the Supreme Court.
Congress that decides by law the number of
Supreme Court justices.
Congress has the authority to decide what
rules of procedure
courts will use, and what rules of
evidence they will use.
Congress has a fair amount of power, not
just to regulate
itself, but to regulate the coordinate
branches of the federal government.
Now I'd be remiss in not mentioning maybe
the most important early case ever decided
under
Article 1, Section 8, on the scope of
Federal power.
The case is McColloch vs Maryland, John
Marshall, Chief
Justice John Marshall in 1819, and he
upheld Congress'
power to pass, to create a national bank,
even
though it doesn't say bank in Article 1,
Section 8.
But a bank was adopted very early on, by
the first Congress.
And James Madison had some objections to
it.
But it passed nonetheless.
And when the bank lapsed, actually,
James Madison was President at the time,
and
he actually signed into law a new bank
bill.
And one of the reasons he did is that, it,
the bank
had been shown that it was actually very
useful for national security.
That it's quite useful, the money is the
sinews of war, and having a central bank
to
borrow money on behalf of the Unites
States
and move money around to give to the
troops.
Very valuable power.
And here's what John Marshall said when he
upheld
the bank.
And I hope you hear in this a
geo-strategic argument.
He said and, and that quote,
we need quote an army quote," To defend a
vast republic from the
Sanquaw to the Gulf of Mexico, from the
Atlantic to the Pacific."
Now he's already claiming in 1819 the
Pacific, you know, California and Oregon.
He's already dreaming this continental
dream.
Manifest destiny, the Monroe Doctrine.
But what he said is, in order to pay
troops on site and on
time, a bank is pretty darn useful.
To move money, from the North to the
South, from the East to the West.
Troops need to be paid on time.
A geo-strategic argument for, a national
security argument for the bank of the
United States.
Unanimous opinion by John Marshall all
about, on behalf, interpreting article 1,
section 8.
Who's John Marshall?
He's the guy who had been there at Valley
Forge with George Washington.
So, you see, again, the national security
and
geo-strategic thrust of Article 1, as a
whole.
Now I wanted just to say a couple of words
about militias, and
then conclude with a few more thoughts
about the last provisions of Article 1.
We have a federal army but
that's permitted but it coexists with
state militias to,
and state militias are a kind of counter
weight.
They can keep check on a central
government if and, and
in the event, a federalist said if, if the
federal government ever
attempted a coup d'éta,t trying to use its
an army to basically just declare
martial law and suspend elections and free
speech, local militias
would be around to resist as local
militias had resisted Parliament during
the American Revolution.
But, to be clear, this was a power only to
be used in the event
of blatant unconstitutionality, where the
federal government cancelled
elections, shut down courts, shut down
free speech.
so, ordinarily, if there's a dispute about
what the federal government has done,
whether it's acted properly or not, the
solution is elections and free speech, and
court cases.
Not taking up arms against the, the
central government, just because one
state has decided that they think
something is improper or unnecessary or
unconstitutional.
As we're going to see later on,
in the 1860s, state militias actually
misbehaved.
They took up arms against a duly elected
government, where there
was complete freedom of speech and debate
for their pro-slavery point
of view, where courts were open and indeed
controlled, generally, by
pro-slavery forces, led by Chief Justice
Roger Taney, a pro-slavery chief justice.
So we're going to see, later on that this
militia power, at the founding, which was
reserved to the states, basically was
abused.
And we today live in a shadow not
just of the Revolutionary War and the
original Constitution,
but the Civil War and its Amendments,
which reflect
a much more pro army vision of the world.
Article 1 ends with some restrictions on
Congress in Article
1, Section 9, and states in Article 1,
Section 10.
A lot of the restrictions on the states
are in the name of national security.
States can't raise armies on their own,
can't keep
warships on their own, can't send without
con, Congressional
consent, can't send troops into war, pick
fights with
foreign nations, can't enter into treaties
with foreign nations.
So consistent with this geo-strategic
vision,
certain foreign policy and military
matters are given
to the central government and not the
states.
But there are certain things that neither
states nor the federal government
can do, a kind of early version of a Bill
of Rights.
Neither states nor the federal government
can pass ex post
facto laws, or bills of attainders, or
titles of nobility.
So, in anticipation of an idea that there
are certain things that no government
should be allowed
to do.
Now, here's one thing, though, that's
missing in general from Article 1.
There's nothing in Article 1, Section 10,
that says, no state shall allow slavery.
There's nothing that says, no state shall
allow slavery after 1808, or after 1876.
There's no clause in the Constitution that
says, Congress
shall have power to eliminate slavery in
the states.
Those turn out to be very pointed
omissions.
We allowed, the framers allowed slavery
not just to continue
to exist, but to, to entrench itself, to
expand, to flourish.
And, as we're going to see in later
chapters,
eventually the consequence of that would
be a civil war.
In our next lectures we're going to talk
about Article 2, the presidency.
And we'll see, even there, the influence
of slavery.
And that's, of course, going to help us
see, eventually, what will happen later in
our story.
Namely, the war between the states.
The Civil War.
So, stay tuned.
