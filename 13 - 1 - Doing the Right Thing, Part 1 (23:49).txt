Welcome back, we're getting close to the
end of
this online course, we're talking, we're
going to talk today and
in the companion lecture on the next to
last
chapter, the penultimate chapter of this,
book, America's Unwritten Constitution.
It's a chapter all about the role
that conscience plays in our system of
government.
We'll focus in particular on the role of
conscientious jurors in our system and
also the role of judicial
conscience.
The written constitution it's a text and
its doesn't implement itself.
It has to be implemented by actual
human beings who have minds and hearts,and
souls and consciouses
and those, human elements, those unwritten
elements, interact with the written text
in distinctive ways.
We've talked in previous sessions about,
the, the, the human
being named George Washington who had a
certain vision of the
Constitution in general and the presidency
in particular, and how that vision
has helped define the nature of
presidential power in America.
That has,
that unwritten human element has glossed
the formal
written text of Article II of the
constitution.
So that was our discussion of George
Washington.
We've talked about other institutions and
persons,um, Federal
judges and the Supreme Court, the House,
the Senate, administrative
agencies too.
Once again, human elements interacting
with formal texts in ways to try to, to,
complete
the textual project by actually
implementing it in the
world with, with human judgement, and
institutional judgement coming in.
We talked about the role that the two
parties have played in completing, the the
un, the, the incomplete text that is
the, the written Constitution.
So, today we're going to continue in
that tradition, and in the, the companion
lecture, and talk as a set about this idea
of, of conscience, of, of, of moral
seriousness and solemnity.
The Constitution at several places,
invites or requires,
people to take oaths to uphold the
Constitution.
[COUGH] There's not
a lot of text about the presidency, and
yet the presidential Oath of Office is
specified word-for-word.
I do solemnly swear that I shall
faithfully execute
the office of President of the United
States and will, to the best
of my ability, preserve, protect, and
defend the Constitution of the United
States.
So, they specify this oath word-for-word
There's another reference
in Article VI, the supremacy clause,
requiring all federal officials
and indeed state officials, state judges,
state lawmakers state
executive officials to swear oaths of
allegiance to the constitution.
The very first bill that the very first
congress in 1789
enacted was a bill specifying the proper
oath of office
to be, a constitutional oath to be taken
be various officials.
You see the idea of oaths loom very large
in early and important cases
like Marbury versus Madison when, the
Fourth Amendment
talks about, how, certain warrants need to
be
supported by people swearing that they
know, that they
know certain things to, that they believe
certain things
to be true on, on, oath or, or
affirmation.
The Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil
War, had some special punishments,
in Section III for officials who had sworn
oaths to the US Constitution and had
betrayed those oaths by taking up arms
against, the Federal System, against the
Constitution, and they were treated more
harshly because they were oath breakers.
So again, and again, and again the
Constitution itself is, is sensitive to
the
idea that they're going to be human beings
and we have to enlist their allegiance.
We have to get them on board with the
project, and we try to do that by getting
them
to swear oaths of allegiance to the
project.
But, but if the Constitution doesn't have,
at least a little bit of give
in it, rule for human judgement, are moral
people going to be willing to sign on to
this project if, there is
no room for them to ever exercise
independent moral judgement?
So, we want them to be committed
to the constitutional project but we also
want them to be morally serious
individuals.
We don't want morally serious individuals
to say well,
I have to, I can't really participate in
the
constitutional project because it's asking
me to surrender too
much of my own judgement and soul, and,
and conscience.
So, we're going eventually, by the end of
todays session, talk about juror,
what's was sometimes called juror
nullification.
The role of, of, of conscience, especially
among criminal jurors.
But before we do that, I want to put
that issue, in a larger structural,
constitutional framework.
And then in the next lecture we'll talk,
we'll continue to talk about juror, juries
and
jurors nd also bring [COUGH] judges a
little
bit more centrally into the picture, and
I'll tell
you about these two folks in robes.
They're, they're pretty famous judges from
the Warren Court era, and I'll tell
you about them at the end of the next
lecture per our tradition
of coming back to the, the pictures that
begin each chapter of these
books that we're talking about, America's
Constitution: a Biography, and America's
Unwritten Constitution.
Those are the two books, of course.
So, take a step back.
Try to
look at the system of the Constitution as
a whole, different branches of government,
two houses of
the legislature, a separate executive
branch, a separate judiciary
which in turn is divided between judges
and juries.
So, why this event system?
You could say, well it's basically to
discourage laws in general.
Laws are liberty-threatening,
the story goes.
I don't buy the story but here's a
standard story that you've heard.
Laws are in general threatening to
liberty.
We want to make it difficult to
pass and enforce laws because laws are
liberty-threatening
and if we have a whole bunch of branches,
actually we're going to have fewer laws.
If a law has to pass both the House, and
the Senate, and be signed
by the President and, get the approval of
judges and juries we're going to have
fewer
laws, in application and that will be a
good thing.
But that standard story, okay, the
Libertarian story, doesn't work so much.
When you have both the House and the
Senate needed to pass a
law, yes, it's possible nothing will pass,
because the House wants bill A, B,
and C, and the Senate wants, has certain
provisions A, B, and C
that are liberty-threatening and the
Senate doesn't
like that, but it prefers D, E,
and F, which are also liberty-threatening
and nothing passes.
Okay, so bicameralism, can lead to nothing
passing and, liberty is safe.
But bicameralism, my friends, can also
lead to a big log roll, legislation, where
the house gets A,B andC and the senate
gets D,E and F, and and the President
haves GH and I and all of this stuff
passes, the President could say I
won't sign the bill you the legislature
want unless you give me my stinky
provisions.
And some of those stinky provisions might
be liberty-threatening.
So, this just without more bicameralism,
the House, the
requirement that both the House and Senate
sign on.
Or the, the presentment, the idea that
generally the
President needs to sign or else have, his
veto overridden.
That could end up leading to more laws
rather
than less, through log rolls, and the
framers were aware of this.
The ability to block a bill is also
the ability as a practical matter,
sometimes to extort
agreement from the other branches for
something that
they wouldn't like in general, but that
you want.
And by the way, even if it were the case
that actually we
end up with fewer laws, that also this,
this system, if it does make
passing stuff more difficult, it also
makes repealing stuff more difficult.
So, suppose we have, on the books, one
stinky law,
one liberty-threatening law, bicameralism
and presentment ordinarily, if it makes
it difficult to pass, maybe it makes it
equally difficult
to repeal and now we've got these laws on
the books.
If you really thought laws were
presumptively
bad, you could provide, you could have
provided, the framers could have, but
didn't,
that every law lapses after a certain
period — 10 years or five years, two
years, whatever — and needs to be
readopted.
But that's not in general what the
constitution does.
It does that for one specific category of
law
that we're going to talk about in a minute
actually.
Laws that create standing armies actually
do lapse every two years.
There's a sunset that automatically built
in.
By the way, you know, sometimes laws don't
threaten liberty, they protect liberty.
Laws, for example, having a census every
ten years protects the rights to vote.
Lots of other laws, that protect our
rights to vote or other important rights.
Laws that actually provide, for, remedies
against
government officials when they violate
your, your rights.
So, not all laws are bad, and if all laws
were bad, then
you might think they should have provided
that they automat, are presumptively bad,
that they should lapse every so often,
but they, that's not what the framers
provided.
And by the way, bicamerals and presentment
can lead to more laws rather less.
So, so, we need to refine this Libertarian
idea
that we have different branches cause laws
are presumptively problematic.
I'm going to suggest instead that our
system is
designed to produce fewer laws of a
certain sort.
Maybe three or four different kinds of
laws are disfavored.
First, laws that create a standing
army are disfavored, because
constitutionally every
army appropriation, every military
appropriation for
a standing army lapses every two years.
The Constitution requires that in, in
Article I, Section IIX.
So, that's a sunset provision, not for all
laws, but for
standing army laws because the framers
were afraid of standing armies.
They thought they were a distinctive
threat to liberty.
Yes, you can have them, but they have to
be re-voted affirmatively every two years.
And every two years there's a new House of
Representatives and all the
House has to do, is simply nothing at all,
just sit on its hands.
You know, think, shut down of a certain
sort.
The House refuses to pass the military
appropriation to bill, the standing army
lapses.
It has to fold its tent and go home.
So, they were concerned about standing
armies, not navies apparently.
They thought armies were more threatening
to domestic
liberty than were a Navy so, so, so
the system is designed to have to, to tilt
against army laws of a certain sort.
It's also designed to have fewer arguably
unconstitutional
or genuinely unconscionable laws, not
fewer laws all together.
But fewer arguably unconstitutional or
unconscionable laws.
How does that work?
You can't have the log roll if you, you,
you are a
person of honor, you've taken an oath to
the Constitution and, and the
things being proposed to you, if you think
it's unconstitutional, then as a
man of honor or woman of honor, you just
have to say no.
So, you want A, B and C and the other
brand say's okay, we'll give
you that, what you want, but only if you
agree to D, E and F, and
if you think D is unconstitutional, or E
or F, even if
you want A, B and C you can't do the log
roll.
You can't say okay, I'll, if you give me
what I want I'll vote for your stuff.
If I sincerely believe it's
unconstitutional, because that would
be perfidious, that would be not faithful
to your oath.
So, the system is not designed to have
fewer laws in general, but fewer
unconstitutional laws.
If the House thinks the law
is unconstitutional, it has to just say
no.
And, and it can't log roll because it
thinks that that was unconstitutional.
Or if the Senate thinks so, it has to say
no.
Or if the President thinks it's
unconstitutional, he has
to veto it and if it's a criminal law,
even if his veto's overridden, he can
refuse to
prosecute under it or he can pardon
everyone who's been,
charged under it, as Thomas Jefferson
famously did.
He thought the Sedition Acts, The Alien
Sedition Acts of 1798,
he thought the sedition act was
unconstitutional so he pardoned everyone.
So, and judges can set aside, not bills
that they don't like, but bills they
sincerely
believe to be unconstitutional and
actually we're going
to see jurors can do the same thing.
So, our system is designed so that an
arguably unconstitutional, or
unconscionable law sort of never gets
implemented.
and, and, and that's true whether the
House thinks it's
unconstitutional or the Senate, or the
President, or judges, or juries.
Each of them has a particular kind of
check,
not against all laws, laws that I think
are bad
policy, or, smelly but no, something they
think is
genuinely unconstitutional because they've
taken an oath of office or
genuinely unconscionable.
Something where they really just can't say
well,
let's compromise on this because if they
are men
and women of conscience, there are certain
things
you have to draw a line in the sand.
You just have to say no, I can't agree to
that.
So, the system is designed not to have
fewer laws in generally but fewer,
standing army laws,
fewer arguably unconstitutional laws,
arguably, unconscionable laws.
And by arguable, I mean one branch
thinks it's unconstitutional, but maybe
another branch doesn't.
And the branch that thinks it's
unconstitutional could be the House, or
the Senate, or the President, or judges,
or as we're going to see, jurors.
It's also our system is designed
to be particularly protective of criminal
defendants
and, and in the criminal justice domain
create multiple checks against
law because criminal law is seen as, as a
place where certain kind of liberty,
bodily liberty your, your life, might be
at stake and if it's capital punishment
law, your, your limbs, your liberty, if
incarceration, is a possible punishment.
So, where, where people's lives and
limbs are involved in the criminal justice
system as
potential defendants there are special
checks and balances against law.
Let me just rehearse them for you.
I'm going to tell you what the federal
system is on
the criminal side, and then to show you
how it's different
and more protective than federal law on
the non-criminal, the civil
side, or is also different than how state
criminal law operates.
Federal criminal law is distinctive.
First, there is no, you need both the
House
and the Senate to vote for a federal
criminal statute.
There is no federal criminal liability
unless both House and Senate are on board.
That's going to be different for example
than in the civil domain, non-criminal,
where sometimes judges on their own can
create liability for a defendent.
If a government official for example
violates your 4th Amendment
rights, the government, the courts have
allowed you to sue.
That government's official directly under
the Fourth Amendment, under the
constitution, if, the, the officer
violated your search and seizure rights.
Even though there's no statute that says
so, federal courts have created civil
liability.
This is called Federal Common Law.
It's judges in effect creating,
certain rules of, of, of liability.
There's no criminal counterpart.
Federal courts have never been able to
create federal criminal liability, only
civil liability.
So, both the House and the Senate have to,
basically, vote for a,
a, a, to make something criminal,
otherwise it's not a federal crime at all.
And that's why when George Washington, and
the
Neutrality Proclamation seemed to suggest
that he could
create federal criminal liability
unilaterally
for people who violated neutrality.
The court very famously, Supreme Court in
the case called Hudson and Goodwin,
a few years later said no, only Congress
can create a federal crime.
And the President has to sign it and, and,
now
if his, and if he vetoes it, it's not a
loss.
Suppose his veto is overridden.
Well, on the civil side,
even if the President doesn't like a bill,
he vetoes it,
the veto's overridden and then he probably
has to enforce it.
And he and, and even if he doesn't enforce
it,
the law can provide for other people to
enforce it.
He, say he doesn't like antitrust laws
where the
law can say civil plaintiffs can, can sue
under antitrust.
So, on the civil side his veto can be
overridden and you can have
private enforcement of, of antitrust laws
or antidiscrimination laws.
Not on the criminal side, even if his
veto's over ridden, he can refuse to
prosecute.
It's called prosecutorial discretion, it's
really non-prosecutorial discretion,
discretion not to prosecute, and no judge
can
force him to prosecute, and no private
person
on the federal level can initiate a
criminal
lawsuit, so on the criminal side he in
effect
he has two vetoes, two pens, his veto pen
that can be overridden by a two-third's
vote, but
he also has his pardon pen, his
non-prosecution pen.
Even if, even if a prosecution occurred,
he could
just pardon the way Jefferson did and
that's final.
So, if the President doesn't like a
Federal criminal
law and people then people aren't punished
by it.
He can,
refuse to prosecute, he can pardon.
So, so, and that's not true on the civil
side.
On the civil side the laws get enforced
maybe even if the president
doesn't like them, thinks they're very
bad, because you can have private
enforcement.
Now, think about the judiciary.
On the criminal side, a judge can
automatically just
say no to a federal criminal law and
jurors
as we're going to see, actually, can also
just
say no, they can acquit, and once the
juror
acquits, or the jury acquits for whatever
reason, the defendant goes free.
That's not true on the civil side, on the
civil side, if a jury doesn't like a
bill, doesn't like a statute, doesn't like
the anti,
you know a civil antitrust laws, or
anti-discrimination laws.
Well, the legislature can create,
actually,
laws that don't even require jury trial.
They are enforced through administrative
agencies
or just by judges sitting in equity,
rather than law.
When they sit on the law side, there's a
jury,
but they can sit sometimes without a jury,
that's called equity.
So, juries could be cut out of the loop
altogether
in federal and civil law, not in federal
criminal law.
There has to be a jury.
You can't ever be convicted, if you demand
a
jury, you get a jury on the criminal side.
That's not always true on the civil side.
You can have administrative agencies and
sometimes judges sitting alone.
[COUGH] So, on the federal criminal side,
six unique checks against
an arguably unfair law.
House a fed, and this is on federal level.
House can say no and there's no law.
Senate can say no, there's no law.
President can say no, not just with a veto
pen,
but pardon pen, nonprosecution power and,
it's not enforced against you.
Judges can say no.
Jurors can say no as well, acquit
against the evidence, what we call jury
nullification.
They can just say, we think it's a stinky
law, we
think it's unconcionable, we're not
going to vote to convict so there.
And that's that, you don't go to prison,
you're not convicted.
None of these things really, in general,
is true on the civil side.
On the civil
side you can have civil liability,
non-criminal liability, even
if the House and the Senate haven't passed
a law.
Federal judges can sometimes create a
thing called federal common law.
Even if the President doesn't like it,
you can have private enforcement where
judges can
sometimes order, precedence can do things
on
the civil side, not on the criminal side.
On the civil side, juries can bet cut out
of the loop altogether, administrative
agencies, judges can sit alone.
So,
federal criminal law is different from
federal civil law.
Federal criminal law is also different
from state criminal law.
The state level actually state judges
sometimes
do create criminal liability on their own.
State level is some states actually do
allow
private prosecutions of, of, of, of, of
crime.
So, federal criminal law is distinctive in
our system.
It's a set of distinct checks against
the coercive power of the federal
government.
and, as I'm going to explain in more
detail in the
next lecture, jurors have a particularly
important role, but that
role is structurally symmetric to the
Libertarian liberty-protective role, that
each of the other five main actors in the
system pass.
So the House of Representatives
can say no, and the Senate can say no, the
President can say no, a judge can say no.
Oh, I should also mention a grand jury at,
in a criminal prosecution, a grand jury
can just say no, we don't think the
person should be indicted and there's no
prosecution.
The trial jury is called the petit jury
petit, meaning small.
It can also say no, but for federal
criminal law a grand jury can
just rear up and say, we're not going to
indict and the 5th Amendment says no one
can
be held for a serious offense, to answer
for a serious offense unless a grand jury
indicts.
That's not true in many states, that's not
true again on the civil side, there's no
civil
law side, there's no counterpart to the,
the grand
jury shield that we see on the criminal
side.
So, all these special checks against
federal criminal law enforcement, House,
Senate,
Presidental veto, non-prosecution and
pardon, a grand
jury's right to just say, no, a kind of
bicameralism within the executive branch.
Either the President or the grand jury can
say,
no, and if either says, no, you go free.
If either the House or the Senate says,
no, there's no federal criminal law on
the books, and if either the judge or the
jury at trial says no you
go free, you walk.
We're going to talk a little bit more
about now the specific
role of, of jurors, their right to rear up
on their
hind legs and just say no, what critics
call jury nullification
what I think is more neutrally described
as acquittals against the evidence.
We're going to talk about that in the next
lecture and we're also
going to talk about what judges should do
if they think criminal law
is savage, unconscienable, inhumane,
and we'll talk about these two characters.
So, stay tuned.
