Hello again, everyone.
My name is Lauren Bizacki and I'm one of
your teaching assistants for this Coursera
course entitled Constitutional Law.
Now, you've had two bonus features so far,
where my other teaching
assistants, Daniel and Danny, have
answered
some of your questions from the forum.
And I've taken the opportunity to do the
exact same thing.
I combed through this most recent
week's forums, discussing the lecture
material, and
I chose a few questions that I thought
were particularly important to address in
this office hour's bonus material.
So I'll go to the first question.
One of your classmates, Johan Keering,
asks, what
is supreme, state constitution, or federal
law?
What is supreme, state constitution, or
federal treaties?
So, really, he's asking two questions.
First, whether federal law and federal.
First, whether federal law would trump a
state constitution.
And second, whether a federal treaty would
trump a state constitution.
And the answer to both is the same.
The federal law and federal treaty will
always
trump a state constitution, so that's the
short answer.
But now I'm going to take a few minutes to
walk you through why,
and to explain some of the issues and
exciting
features of our system of legal hierarchy
of laws.
So I've prepared a slide that outlines the
different
types of laws that we have in our country.
And if you take a look at this slide,
you'll see at the very top, is the
Constitution.
The Constitution is the supreme law of the
land.
And as such, it will always trump any of
the other types of laws that you see below
it.
And I'm going to go into a little bit more
detail later on, explaining why.
But I want you to notice, that it's at the
top,
and that no one disagrees about the
supremacy of this document.
So next, below the Constitution, you'll
see federal statutes.
And what federal statutes are, are laws
that are
passed by the Federal Congress, the House
of Representatives, and
the Senate, and then signed into law by
the President.
Below federal statutes, you'll see
treaties.
Treaties are unique, in that it does not
require both houses to pass a treaty.
Treaties cut out the House
of Representatives from the treaty-making
process.
And so, that is where the federal type of
laws end, and the next two we see are
related to states.
And that's state constitutions, followed
by state laws.
Now what you'll notice on the side, the
right side of
that slide, is that there's an arrow
pointing up saying more democratic.
And what that means is that these laws,
the supremacy of these laws that is, are
arranged based on how democratic they are.
So you'll see at the top
the Constitution, that is the most
democratic law that we have on any,
in any of our books, whether it's state or
federal, in our nation.
And why is that?
Well it's for the exact same reasons that
we've
been discussing throughout this course,
and the earlier lectures.
The Constitution was ordained by the
people.
That is, it was ratified by the states,
and in those state ratifying
conventions, we had even lower property
requirements
than we did to vote for other laws.
The Constitution was not established by a
small
number of legislators, but rather, the
entire nation.
So as such, it's the most democratic form
of law.
And as you go down, the laws become less
democratic.
And what I mean by less democratic is,
that they're less representative
of the people.
So for instance, I just discussed how
treaties cut out the House of
Representatives,
and it's commonly noted that the House
of Representatives is the people's branch
of government.
And then all the way down at the bottom,
state laws cut out
all the people in those other 49
states, and they're established by state
legislatures.
And so, as you can see, at the very top,
we have a more democratic law, and
we go down from there.
Now, this hierarchy of democracy is
important to the supremacy of these laws.
And Professor Amar, in his chapter about
the law of
the land, the lecture that you just
watched, outlines in
great detail in his America's
Constitution, A Biography book, all
of the arguments for why this hierarchy of
laws is true.
And one of those being this gradient of
democracy.
I did just want to highlight for you, that
there is debate about whether
federal statutes or federal treaties,
trump one another.
That is, what happens when a statute on
one
hand, and a federal treaty on the other
hand, conflict.
Now, under this,
under this slide, under this gradient we
see, Professor Amar
would answer, that indeed the federal
statute would trump the treaty.
However, there is scholarly debate as well
as
judicial indecisiveness, about what would
happen in that case.
Now the, the majority of the judicial
branch doesn't have a
clear consensus about whether a statute or
a treaty, would trump one
another based on those distinctions.
And professor Amar argues in his chapter
in this book,
that the judicial branch thus is being
unfaithful to the Constitution.
And professor Amar outlines a number of
arguments, for why this hierarchy
specifically statutes
trumping treaties, should be followed by
the
courts, and is true to our Constitution.
And I'm not going to go into all of those
arguments.
But I just wanted to take time to
highlight
a few of those, so you understand some of
the
the, the points that are in dispute, and
some of
the working parts behind this question of
the supremacy clause.
So if we take a look at this supremacy
clause itself in the Constitution,
which is found in article six, it states,
this Constitution,
so, it's stating the constitution first.
And the laws of the United States, which
shall be made in pursuance thereof.
So, second, it mentions these federal
laws.
And all treaties made, or which shall be
made, under the authority of the United
States.
So next it mentions treaties.
Shall be the supreme law of
the land.
And the judges in every state shall be
bound thereby.
Anything in the constitution or laws of
any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
So the last part of article six, of
this paragraph of article six, then
mentions the state.
Now what Professor Amar argues is that
this order,
that is outlined in the Constitution, the
Constitution, federal statutes, treaties,
and then state law, is important for our
understanding of supremacy.
That is, the supremacy clause itself
outlines
the order of the supremacy of the laws.
And he makes a doctrinal point, about why
we should obsect, accept this argument.
And I'm going
to read now from his chapter.
For those of you that are following along,
it's page 303.
And Professor Amar argues, in Marbury v
Madison,
Chief Justice Marshall, in emphasizing the
legal priority of
the constitution, deemed it not entirely
unworthy of observation,
that article six supremacy clause listed
the Constitution first.
Isn't it likewise worthy of notice that
this very
same clause listed federal statutes ahead
of federal treaties?
Thereby implying a rank order between the
two.
So that's just a little introduction to
some of the arguments surrounding the
supremacy clause.
And, and the debate about whether statutes
or
treaties trump one another, when they're
in direct conflict.
I'd like now to move on to a second
question
I found in the discussion forums for this
week's lectures.
And this comes from someone named Dominic.
Dominic asks, in the lecture, the
professor mentioned that if enough
states decide, they can request Congress
to call a proposing convention.
I don't think the professor explained how
many states constitute enough states,
please explain.
So the amendment process for the
Constitution
is outlined in article five of the
Constitution, right next to article six
that
we were just discussing about the
supremacy clause.
And article five of the Constitution, I'm
not going to read it
out loud, it's kind of long and there's a
lot of or's.
There's a lot of different clauses.
There's a lot going on there, and so I
prepared a slide to help kind of break
it down and explain the amendment process
a little bit better.
So, the amendment process is a two-step
process.
And, any amendment requires that both of
these
steps be met, before the Constitution can
be amended.
So, the first step, is that amendments may
be adopted and
sent to the states for ratification by one
of two mechanisms.
So, either of these two mechanisms would
allow the
amendment to be adopted and then sent to
the states.
So the first mechanism, is that two thirds
of
the Senate and the House of
Representatives must propose
to adopt this amendment.
And that's known as a super majority.
So it requires both houses of the
legislature, two- thirds.
Not the normal 50% or the normal majority
required, but a super
majority, which is much more difficult to
achieve and often requires
the help of both parties and the support
of both parties.
Or,
now this is an or, not an and, or a
national convention, assembled at
the request of the legislature of at least
two thirds of the states.
And now this is what Dominic was asking
about.
So currently, two thirds of the states
would be 34 states.
And 34 states, would have to request this
national convention.
The last
national convention we had, was the
ratification convention for the initial
Constitution itself.
It has been hundreds of years before we've
had a national convention.
Now just because states aren't requiring
this national convention to propose
amendments, doesn't
mean that it's not a powerful clause of
this article of the Constitution.
Just the threat that
states have the power, to make Congress do
something, has had
effects in Congress proposing amendments
that they knew the state wanted.
That is, if a lot of states were
threatening this huge national convention,
to create an amendment
for the Constitution, Congress can heed
those threats and
can themselves instead, under a two thirds
super majority,
propose these amendments.
And so we haven't seen
any of these national Constitutions yet.
None of the 27 amendments that we have now
have taken that path, it is a possibility.
Okay, so after we clear step one, of the
two
stop process for constitutional amendment,
then there is a second step.
So the second step is, that the amendment
must be ratified.
And it must be ratified again,
in one of two different ways.
In the Constitution, article five actually
outlines that Congress can
decide which of these two ways the
amendment must be ratified.
So it gives Congress that authority.
So the first way the amendment
can be ratified, is if the legislatures of
three fourths of the state,
which is again, thir excuse me.
Three fourths of the states, which is 38
states, can ratify the amendment.
Or the second, is that state ratifying
conventions in three fourths
of the state, which is again 38 states,
can ratify the amendment.
And so you see a difference there
between the legislature and the state
ratifying conventions.
Now the legislature being a group of
elected officials much like
our federal House of Representatives and
Senate, but at the state level.
Now, we only have one instance where
Congress mandated that the
state ratifying convention of three
fourths
of the states ratify the amendment.
And in this case, that's the 21st
Amendment, which became part of the
Constitution
in 1933.
To date, that is the only amendment that
we have, that would required the state
ratifying conventions.
So as you can see by this two step
process, article
five mandates, a process that is not
entirely left to Congress.
That is, we don't want to give Congress
the
ability to change the Constitution
entirely on its own.
And people have wondered, why wouldn't we
want to do that?
Well, one hypothetical that really
illustrates this point,
is that Congress could amend the
Constitution on
their own to say that we're not going to
have an, another election in four years.
Or we're not going to give up our seats in
congress, we are the perpetual congress.
And they could take out the republican
form
of government clause and do all these
things.
And sure, there would be a public outcry.
But if we allowed Congress to amend the
Constitution on its own, we
would be giving a significant amount of
authority to that law making body.
And so as you can see, the two
step process for constitutional amendments
requires, the help,
really, of people in the states, whether
it
be the legislatures, or the state
ratifying conventions.
And without that consensus, amendments
don't happen in America.
Some scholars have said that the amendment
process is too difficult, while
others have actually rejoiced in this
difficulty of amendment.
These two third requirements, and the
Congress and the states.
Because we have we have a document and
it's difficult to
change, and some argue that many of the
great things of our document then, are
difficult to change, and they are not
exposed to the political pressures of
existing congresses.
So, those were the two questions from the
recent material that I thought
were really interesting to consider and
that a lot of you were wondering about.
I encourage you to find the original
posts.
Maybe we can even link to them from
this video.
If you have further thoughts on the
issues, as I said, this was really just a
brief, cursory overview of the supremacy
clause, and
some of the debates and arguments
surrounding it.
And the article five procedure for
Constitutional amendment.
And there are certainly many more aspects
of each of
these articles to explore between each
other on the discussion board.
And, I know that, in all the posts I've
seen so far many of you have
a great handle on the Constitution
already, and
have been really invaluable help for your
fellow classmates.
In helping outline some of the issues that
we've talked about today, and other issues
as well.
So, this ends our office hours for today.
If you have questions, make sure to keep
posting them.
We will be going through the discussion
boards and replying, as well as taking
some of the questions
and answering them on screen for you like,
like I did today.
Thank you, and have a great day.
