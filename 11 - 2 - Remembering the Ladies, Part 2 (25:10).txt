Welcome back.
In this lecture and, and the one
before it, we're taking seriously Abigail
Adams' plea
to her husband John Adams, that we need
to remember the ladies, and we're talking
about
the role of women's rights in particular
in
the constitution and the ways in which the
special commitment to women's rights is
part of,
not merely America's written constitution
in the 14th
Amendment in the 19th Amendment, but
part of America's unwritten constitution
as well.
Because I think the 19th Amendment means
more
than it's words read narrowly and in
isolation.
I seem to imply.
In the last lecture I basically made a
kind of, a reverse enactment argument.
Remember, earlier on I said, we can deduce
certain principles
from the very process by which a
constitutional provision or an amendment
was enacted.
We can deduce the idea of free speech from
the very adoption of the Constitution, and
majority rule.
We can deduce a broad principle
of Republican government from the very
process.
By which the 14th amendment was adopted.
Well here, the very process, by which the
19th
amendment was adopted is in some ways not
re,
self-reinforcing but, self, undermining,
because as soon as the 19th
amendment was adopted it kind of calls
into question, the
fairness of the process that led to it,
because women
weren't allowed to vote everywhere on
whether women could vote.
That's the whole point of the 19th
Amendment is to let women
vote everywhere, precisely because they
weren't
being allowed to vote everywhere before
that.
And so the process that generated,
processes in which in some states
women could vote but not in other states.
On the 19th Amendment itself now seems a
little bit problematic because why, why
should women have been excluded from the
process once the 19th Amendment was
adopted.
The 19th Amendment says women should be
politically equal.
so, you might say, well, what else might
the
19th Amendment imply that's not just on
the surface.
Let's take the rules of marriage.
You might think the 19th Amendment says
nothing at all about marriage.
It's about voting, women are equal voters,
professor.
What the heck does that have to do with
marriage?
Well, here's one thing.
Traditionally, husband and wife had a, a
unity of domicile.
They had to actually live, reside in the
same place.
That's part of what marriage is about.
But after the 19th Amendment, does that
work?
Suppose he wants to vote in District X,
and she wants to vote in District Y, and
the 19th Amendment says she
has a right to vote, and her right to vote
shouldn't be dependent on him.
And so, so, the 19th Amendment might have
some very interesting
implications of a woman's right to have,
for example, a separate domicile.
Let's, let's take, actually since we're
talking about marriages
let's talk about the marriages in the
White House itself.
And how the 19th Amendment actually has
revolutionized.
Its really transformed the nature of
presidential and vice presidential
politics and relations.
Now, Abigail Adams, whom I've
mentioned already, she's a very forceful
political figure.
She's not so different, you see, from
Eleanor Roosevelt.
But in Abigal Adams era, she has to kind
of
be a little bit cautious and she's not
holding press
conferences and writing op eds the way
Eleanor Roosevelt would
later because if Abigal Adams gets too far
out in front.
She's giving advice to John all the time.
She's a very politically savvy person,
she's, the,
the wife of one president, the mother of
another John Quincy Adams as a president
to be.
But, but but if she's out there visibly,
she's going to offend some traditionalist
men and she's not
going to help her husband or her son so
much because men are the only ones who
voted.
Now Eleanor Roosevelt is different,
because when she's out there women
are voting.
And so maybe some men are offended, but
she's electrifying women.
So we see the emergence of a, a kind of a,
a new kind of tag team, two for the price
of one.
Franklin goes after the moderates, Eleanor
goes after the crusaders.
He tells his male friends in private,
well, I can't control my wife, can you.
And, you know, he kind of, they, they
laugh,
but behind the scenes he's telling her.
Go for it, two for the price of one, a new
kind of political ticket, so to speak.
And, and you see that, and that's a 19th
Amendment phenomena, and you see, not just
Franklin and Eleanor, you see that with
Bill
and Hillary, two for the price of one.
Barrack and Michelle.
But these new
dynamics, a new role for the first lady
this is, this is an entailment, and
implication albeit unwritten of the 19th
Amendment and the role that women
are now actually playing as equal voters.
So think about the vice president.
At the founding
we move very quickly to an idea of a
kind of presidential
tag team, presidents and vice presidents
be, are sort of a ticket
but but now after the 19th Amendment, the
president
has another running mate so to speak, his
spouse.
At the founding John Addams, and Thomas
Jefferson, and
Alexander Hamilton, they're all keeping an
eye on each other.
They maybe all want to succeed Washington
eventually and so they're founding rivals.
When Washington leaves the stage they're
going to, they're going to all
be vying for this top position and they're
eyeing each other very suspiciously.
But no one's worried about Martha
Washington.
She's not going to succeed George.
But now
it's possible you see that, that, that,
that President's can be succeeded by their
spouses as Governors have been succeeded
by their spouses and And Al
Gore has to think about Hilary Clinton,
for example, in a way the founders didn't
have to think about Martha Washington as a
possible, political heir apparent.
So the, the very dynamics
of Presidential succession, the role of
the Vice President have been, I think
transformed by the deep, albeit, unwritten
logic of the 19th Amendment.
Let's talk about the two, two of the most
famous cases decided in the 20th century
involving women's rights.
Griswold versus Connecticut and Roe versus
Wade.
In an
earlier chapter we talked about American's
lived constitution.
And under a kind of traditionalist
approach, a Burkian approach based
on custom, you could say, well, Griswold
was a pretty easy case.
Connecticut was the only state in the
union, it actually made it a
crime for married couples to use
contraception in the privacy in their
bedroom.
That was a weird law, and outlier,
eccentric, unAmerican so to speak.
Out of sync with deep American customs and
traditions.
And so it can be invalidated just on
background alone, and that what we talked
about.
Roe, you see, can't quite make that
argument because
laws proscribing, prohibiting abortions in
various contexts were quite prominent.
Roe announced some sweeping rules about
the abortion
right that were way ahead of actual
practice in
the several states at the time.
The rules that the Supreme Court announced
in 1973 in Roe versus Wade,
in fact, rendered unconstitutional, the
laws of, I think 49 of the 50 states.
Only New York, satisfied Roe's rule.
So, Griswold invalidated, one state law,
Connecticut, which is a weird one.
Griswold can be defended on traditionalist
grounds.
Rowe,
not so much.
Hard to defend on, on traditionalist
grounds because it's, it's striking down
all
sorts of laws that, that have deep roots,
that have tradition on their behalf.
That doesn't mean Rowe is necessarily
wrong we'd want to
think about this unwritten constitution,
of, of, of American Feminism.
We have to remember the ladies.
So, here's a different way of thinking
about both Griswold and Roe.
I think it would be outlandish to think
that the 19th Amendment
requires us to disregard all laws that
were passed before women voted.
The 19th Amendment doesn't basically say,
repudiate the
entire legal experience before women got
the vote.
That it purports to be an amendment to an
existing ongoing system.
But there are certain kind of law that may
be are problematic because
of the logic of the 19th Amendment.
A certain kind of law passed before women
got the vote, that imposed particular
disabilities on women as women
disabilities of, of childbearing and, as a
practical matter, childrearing.
Disabilities that might have made it more
difficult for women to be equal
legislators and
judges and lawyers and, and, and political
participants and so it's
possible to set of laws that were adopted
before women have
the vote that might self-entrenching in
certain ways, might make it
actually difficult for women to repeal,
even after women got the vote.
Arguably, the laws in both Griswold and
Roe were of this sort.
Here's a key fact about Griswold that we
haven't talked about before.
The law in Griswold was adopted by
Connecticut initially
at a time when no woman could vote in
Connecticut.
It was all adopted long before woman
suffrage.
And so to actually, the law in
in Texas that was at issue in Roe versus
Wade.
So these laws, as a practical matter, are
having women and only women bear children.
Because only women bear children.
If you prohibit contraception, or you
prohibit abortion, you're
going to have more unwanted pregnancies,
carried to term,
perhaps and, and so now women are having
babies
that they might've preferred not to have
and then taking
care of them typically.
in, in, that, it, at least, in infancy.
And so, instead of being in the house; as
in the House of Representatives.
They're in the home, that is their,
their private dwelling places taking care
of kids.
So, so, so there are fewer women in the
house and the senate.
Because women are in the home, there are
fewer women in the House and the Senate.
And and cabinet positions, and
the judiciary, and, and law firms.
now, this is not an airtight argument.
in, in a variety of ways.
But one argument might be, for certain
laws
that were passed before women had the
vote.
And then imposed certain special
disabilities on
women that might make it difficult,
actually,
for women themselves, to strike these laws
of the books, to get them repealed.
Here's maybe what we should do.
We should wipe the slate clean, not of all
loss before women have
the suffrage but, only of these laws
targeted at women and entrenching possibly
and
entrenching their anti-woman effect.
Those laws should be wiped off the books
after women get, the vote and if they're
repassed, in a process in which women are
equal participants, well that would be
very different.
But we shouldn't merely perpetuate these
old laws that were, that imposed special
disabilities on women, as women, and
that women themselves didn't initially
vote for.
That's the kind of modest middle position
that's hardly airtight.
Because you could say, well, these laws
don't
discriminate against women, they are about
contraception and abortion.
And not all women, for example, en, en,
engage
in procreative sex and not all women are
pregnant.
Yes, but, but only women are going to
actually be bearing the children here.
And so whether it is formally sex based or
not,
isn't it as a practical matter just
because
it is targeting only a subset of women.
Isn't that on account of sex within the
relevant
meaning of say the let's say the 19th
Amendent.
Let's imagine a law that said, we allow
women to
vote, not pregnant women; however, because
pregnancy just discombobulates that.
So this is not, this is not a
violation of the 19th amendment, we're
letting women vote,
just not pregnant women.
If you think that would be
unconstitutional as a violation of the
19th Amendment idea, you're saying laws
that target pregnancy as such, are laws
on account of sex, within the meaning of
the 19th Amendment and
now the only question is, whether other
laws, that target pregnancy as such.
And that impose disabilities on pregnant
person
as such, might be threatening to the
idea, the deep idea of women's equality at
the heart of the 14th and 19th amendment.
If, as a practical matter, these laws are
going to be
more difficult, are going to impose
disabilities on women as women and be
difficult for women to undo, to repeal
even after they've
formally got the vote because these laws
are kind of keeping them at home rather
than in but as full and equal political
participants.
I do not mean to suggest that we've just
come up
with a knock down argument in support of,
of Roe versus Wade.
Roe versus Wade is a very complicated
issue.
There's the issue of unborn, innocent
human life on the other side.
What I do mean to suggest, is that in
addition to arguments
of custom and tradition that we've talked
about before, we
have to think about arguments of women's
equality as central.
And one very interesting fact to pay
attention to is when certain laws that
limit women's options and opportunities,
when those laws were adopted.
If they were adopted before women's
suffrage, might
be these laws be particularly suspect and
vulnerable.
Precisely because the 19th Amendment calls
into question,
to some extent, the fairness of what went
before.
That's the deep, albeit, unwritten
thought.
So I'll give you one other example and
then we'll wrap up as is
the tradition in, in this lecture series.
I want to focus you on the
the picture that animates the relevant
chapter of the book because
there is a chapter called remembering the
ladies Americas Feminist Constitution.
Just to remind you, it's it's Chapter 7 of
the book.
Here's the book, America's Unwritten
Constitution that we're going through.
This is a cartoon in the 1910s.
It's a cartoon, actually a political
cartoon
that appears actually
in 1915.
Right when America is in the middle of
this conversation,
of course about Women's suffrage the 19
teens, the progressive era.
And it, it shows obviously a very
emotional
all male jury rendering the verdict of not
guilty.
Apparently there's a woman defendant who
is not guilty.
Maybe she done something to here husband
in self
defense or something.
She's being hugged apparently by her
lawyer, who has
a handkerchief and he's been playing to
the jury's emotions.
And so they rendered the verdict not
guilty.
And here's the caption quote, women are
too sentimental for jury duty, end quote.
Whose that attributable to, that idea that
women are too sentimental for jury duty.
That's an anti-suffrage argument.
This cartoon, has embedded within it, a
deep constitutional theory.
One is it says, well, you know, woman, men
can be sentimental too.
Why are we singling out woman?
So there's an egalitarian thought here,
but when they
say anti-suffrage argument, here's what
they're saying, when women
vote, that's going to entail, that's going
to mean, that
women are going to be on juries as well.
Even though the 19th Amendment
may not say, the women suffrage amendments
that are being passed in state
constitution after
state constitution might not explicitly
say, women
have a right to serve equally on juries.
That is the logical entailment.
Of women suffrage.
Women have a right to vote, and if they
have a right to
vote for ordinary elections, why don't
they have a right to serve on juries.
Textually we can say, why don't they have
a right to vote on juries and in jury and
jury boxes and, and in legislative
assemblies.
So the deep logic here of this political
cartoon, is
that the 19th Amendment of the women's
suffrage revolution is
not just about voting nearly understood
its about women's full
and equal participation in all sorts of
realms of government.
In the jury box, I would say in the
legislature,
where does it say that women have a right
to, to run for President?
It doesn't explicitly in the written
constitution, and the written constitution
in
Article two says he, him, his when it
refers to the constitution.
And for founding, they are wondering
whether presidents are going to be kings,
or like kings, they're never asking
whether
presidents are going to be like queens.
And at the founding of some states, say
Connecticut, had passed
a law saying, we're going to let
presidential candidates's names appear on
the ballot but only male presidential
candidates.
It's hard to imagine that's an
unconstitutional
at the founding, because that's actually,
those were
the rules, in virtually all the states,
that
only men voted and could be voted for.
But today, is it imaginable that a state
could say, women
candidates for president, say Hilary
Clinton, you know,
Michelle oh, Bachman, Sarah Palin.
Take your pick.
What, is it imaginable that a state could
say, women candidates names can't appear
on the ballot?
I think it's not imaginable.
But if you ask that that, that is
unconstitutional, a, a law like that.
But where does the written constitution
say so in so many words, it doesn't.
And, if we are to find the deep root of
this principle that
women have a right, not just to vote but
to be voted for.
Right to run
for president, right to be president.
To serve as president.
I think it's an unwritten implication of
the 19th Amendment.
It's just connected to this cartoon.
If women are are, are
fit to vote, they are fit to serve
in juries, they're fit to serve in the
legislature.
They're fit to run for office, they're fit
to be President and, and cabinet officers,
and judges.
They are equal political participants.
That's the deep logic of this political
cartoon.
That, that, that this suffrage movement
has deeper and broader entailments and
implications.
And actually here's a reading suggestion
for you if you're interested in this.
The one of the most famous short stories
of this era, is a
short story by a woman named Susan Glaspo.
It's entiled, A Jury of Her Peers.
It becomes a Broadway play called Trifles.
I don't want to ruin it too much.
But, but just in a nutshell, it's about
how the men end up missing all sorts
of things.
And women notice things that we, we
men sometimes just sort of miss important
things.
And it's called a Jury of Her Peers.
And in its context, of course, it's all
about women's suffrage.
You know, it's, it's, it's understanding
deep connections
between, the debate about whether women
should be voters.
And debates about whether they should also
be jurors.
And in many of the states,
actually as soon women become voters,
state supreme court
say, oh that has to be equal jurors do
that.
The right to vote equally on juries.
The U.S. Supreme Court eventually says
that women
have a right to serve equally on juries.
But unfortunately it does that many years
after the 19th Amendment
and doesn't rely on the 19th Amendment as
it should have.
Cause this is a deep logical implication,
the
19th Amendment, that women are political
equals and
all sorts of domains of life.
Let me finally just come back to the
the letter that Abigale Adams wrote to
John Adams.
This is in the spring of 1776 here's what
she writes in a private letter to her
husband John.
I long here, excuse me, I long to hear
that you have declared an independency.
That you've declared independence.
And by the way, in the new code of laws,
which I
suppose it will be necessary for you to
make, I desire you
would remember the ladies, and be more
generous and favorable to them and your
ancestors.
Do not put such unlimited power in the
hands of the husbands.
Remember, all men would be tyrants if they
could.
If particular care and attention is not
paid to the ladies, we are
determined to foment a rebellion and will
not hold ourselves bound to any laws.
In which we have had.
In, in which we have no voice or
representation.
So 1776, even before the Declaration of
Independence and before the Constitution,
Abigail Adams
is saying, you know, gee, this no
taxation without representation, this
consent of the governed.
Why are we being bound by laws in which we
have no proper voice or representation.
And at the founding, the ideas actually
well
your, your husbands really do virtually
represent you.
But my friends, that was the very logic
that you, that women
are virtually represented by their
husbands,
their brothers, their fathers, their,
their sons.
That's the very logic that's reputing by
the 19th Amendment itself.
It says no, women actually get to
represent themselves.
You don't have to count on the men to vote
for them.
And so the deep idea that I want you to
take seriously is that the
19th Amendment suggest that, that, that we
need to pay attention to
Abigail Adams, to remember the ladies
because John Adams didn't quite pay
attention and the women did formate to
rebellion 1st and the 14th
amendment they got that the idea of birth
equality, in the constitution.
And women were there along side men.
People like Elizabeth Katie Statton along
side the John Binghams,
the Grimm K sisters and others.
So, the, the first thing they got was a
14th amendment, who's section one said
that everyone's equal.
Black in birth.
Black and white.
Male and female.
Jew and Gentile.
And the second revolution.
The 19th amendment in which they put in
the idea of political equality.
And then actually a third revolution,
unwritten, later in the 20th century.
In which feminist basically took these
ideas of
women's equality and broadened and
deepened them and said, you know,
we have to be equal in all sorts of
domains of life.
And in that era, the Supreme Court, in
effect
read the 14th Amendment and the 19th
Amendment together to
be, in effect, the equivalent of what the
Equal Rights
Amendment, never adopted, proposed but
never adopted, would have meant.
Today, our courts pretty much act, I
think, similarly to how they would if
the ERA had, in fact, been ratified.
So, Abigail, we do
remember you.
you, Abigail, you were the preeminent
founding mother, and, and wife and in our
next couple lessons, lectures, we're
going to move from that
preeminent founding mother, Abigail Adams
and consider
a founding father, who towers head and
shoulders above everyone else in his
generation.
Of course, we're going to talk about
George Washington, so stay tuned.
