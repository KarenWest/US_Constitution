Welcome back.
It'd be nice to think that the eventual
elimination of slavery through the 13th
Amendment, the promise of
equal civil rights for African Americans
in the 14th Amendment.
The promise of equal voting rights on
account of race in the 15th Amendment.
It'd be nice to think that all of these
things even
though they weren't done by the founders,
were really anticipated by the founders.
If the founders put America on a path
whereby
things like the 13th, 14th and 15th
Amendments would be
the inevitable culmination of a
declaration of independence that
promised that and proclaimed, that all men
were created equal.
There will be a nice story.
But it's not true.
The framers created a last a pro-slavery
system,
a system that actually got worse and worse
and worse as time went on, and actually
collapsed, broke, fell, because of the
weight of slavery.
The presidency, both in Article 2 and then
in the 12th
Amendment, was basically designed to
advantage the slave holding South the.
Because the
3 5ths Clause gave southern slave holding
states extra clout in the Electoral
College.
The West was open to slavery.
constitutionally, Congress could prohibit
slavery but wasn't obliged to do so.
And and as a result of, of, of these facts
The presidency leans toward the South.
Slave
states actually became more virulent many
of
them in their defense of slavery more
aggressive in their
commitment to slavery.
They elected increasingly
extreme pro-slavery presidents from
Jefferson to Jackson to Pierce and
Buchanan.
They shut down free speech in, in the
South.
It was a crime to criticize slavery in
many parts of the South, a capital
offense.
In, in, in many parts North Carolina
for example preachers in the pulpit were
imprisoned,
prosecuted and imprisoned, for preaching
that slavery was a sin.
When Northern Congressmen tried to speak
out
against slavery, southerners actually
tried to indict
them for their anti-slavery speech and
demand
that they, they stand trial down south.
When Charles Sumner gives a speech against
slavery, he's almost,
he's, he's his head is smashed in by
Charles Sumner is
a Massachusetts anti-slavery Senator.
And when he gives a speech against
slavery, his head is smashed
and he's almost killed by a pro-slavery
southern Congressman named Preston Brooks.
And the South actually enthusiastically
supports Brooks.
And, and basically sends him.
Letter saying hit him again, you know,
next time.
You didn't finish the job the first time.
So, the south wants
to expand slavery, not just into the south
west, but into the northwest, into Kansas
and Nebraska, wants to acquire many
southern slavery expansionists.
Cuba, Mexico, maybe even Brazil to create
a vast, slaveocratic empire, and there's
nothing in the Constitution that prohibits
that, if they, manage to get the votes.
And, the only reason, one of the only
reason they, they don't manage
to get the votes is actually kind of luck.
Luckily Americans
tend to flow faster into the Northwest
than into the Southwest.
And so, so basically anti-slavery forces
win
the footrace for western land in general,
and are able to thwart some of
the, the most extreme Southern pro-slavery
policies.
But, let's be clear.
Abe Lincoln wins in 1860, kind of not
because of the Electoral
College in, in the spirit of the original
Electoral College rules, but despite that.
The Electoral College was rigged in favor
of the pro-slavery South and Lincoln wins
nonetheless.
He, as I said before the
first anti-slavery president in American
history.
And by anti-slavery, he's not extreme,
he's just is just the first president to
say, as president, slavery is wrong and we
should eventually get rid of it.
Now, John Quincy Adams is opposed to
slavery, doesn't love it, but as
president he's got a guy from South
Carolina as his vice president John
C.Calhoun.
He's only starts talking about slavery
after he leaves the presidency, when he no
longer needs to get Southern votes in
order to get himself into the the,
the White House.
So
George Washington actually frees his
slaves upon
his death after he leaves the presidency.
But doesn't as president ever say, my
fellow Americans
we should put slavery on the path of
ultimate extinction.
I think he does signal that in a way on,
on his death bed.
Very kind of quietly.
But, but Lincoln is the first openly
anti-slavery president.
And in fact, before Lincoln, there's no
openly anti-slavery cabinet officer.
And, as we've seen the judges, many of
them, are,
are emphatically pro-slavery, put on the
bench by pro-slavery presidents.
So, the system isn't getting gradually
better on
slavery, thanks to the great wisdom of the
framers.
It'd be nice if that were the story.
That's not how it happened.
The system is getting worse
decade by decade, more slavery more
pro-slavery.
Slavery is a cancer that's growing and
growing and you see it
in the presidency, and you see, thank,
thanks to the Electoral College.
And you see it on the court, in the Dred
Scott case, and
you see it in the states when they try to
shut down political discourse.
And you see it in the west with the
Kansas-Nebraska Act and
other things that are trying to basically
expand slavery into the Northwest.
So, so slavery is this cancer, and Lincoln
manages to win despite the built-in
headwinds
against his anti-slavery vision.
And, if the south, the pro-slavery south
had been
smart, you would never have had anything,
even after Lincoln's
election, like the 13th, 14th, and 15th
Amendments.
Lincoln's, Lincoln doesn't get a popular
majority, gets less than 40%
of the popular vote a slim majority in the
Electoral College.
But not a popular mandate of any sort.
His party doesn't have a control of the
House or the Senate in fact.
So all the South has to do is just wait
him out.
They've been winning the game almost
every time until Lincoln.
And all they have to do is basically
just say no to everything that Lincoln
proposes.
Kind we've call it that like the Mitch
McConnell strategy in Obama's first term.
All they have to do to Lincoln is just say
no.
And Lincoln is basically a failed one term
president.
He can't really, he won't, he's not going
to be able to
accomplish very much He's what he can do,
he can appoint pro anti-slavery
governors to the western territories, who
will no longer
participate in the rigging of elections in
places like
Kansas in favor of, pro-slavery forces, so
we can,
he can do a little bit in the west.
He can try to ensure that abolitionist
literature circulates in the south.
Because the south has basically
banned anti-slavery pamphlets from, from
circulating.
So Lincoln, because he controls the post
office, maybe can do that.
Because he controls appointments of
territorial
governors, can do a little bit there.
He can try to build a bit of a, a
Republican party
in the, the south, but boy, it's going to
be an uphill battle.
Abe Lincoln gets zero popular votes, not
electoral
votes, popular votes, South of Virginia in
1860.
because the
south has become such a closed, intolerant
society, basically in effect it's a crime
to
be a member of the Republican party, and
to support Lincoln's vision when you're
down south.
And Lincoln can try to do a little bit.
But, but his, his, prospects are pretty
limited.
If the south simply, basically shuts him
down by staying at the table and blocking
everything, but instead the hotheads in
South Carolina and elsewhere.
Take up arms against the duly elected
government.
At Fort Sumter, fire upon the Union flag,
even though Lincoln had been elected fair
and square,
and even though secession was
unconstitutional under the founding,
for reasons that we've talked about at
great length.
But the hotheads in South Carolina
first, unilaterally declare their
secession before Lincoln
has even taken office in December of 1860.
And then, in early 1861 after Lincoln,
shortly after Lincoln's inaugural address.
Lincoln hasn't done anything particularly
provocative really but
they launch an unprovoked bombardment of
Fort Sumter.
And as a result of that, their
hotheadedness, they bring about something
that was utterly unimaginable had they
simply played the Democratic aim.
The universal, immediate, uncompensated
emancipation of
slaves within the next five years.
And it's just stunning that something like
that could happen.
Rarely in history have cannons backfired
so explosively
and So why, in retrospect were they so
dumb
because, but if they'd played the game
long-term maybe
a
slavery might have ended, even on
Lincoln's agenda, in 100 years.
But they would have gotten $0.95 on the
dollar, they would have gotten all the
value
of their slaves, they would have been able
to transition to new economic ways of
life, so.
So why were they so dumb, and my answer
basically
is because they were arrogant and drunk
with power and evil.
Slavery is tyrannical, tyrants actually
live a life
of arrogance.
And they actually are contemptuous of
others.
They don't want to hear other points of
view.
So they were overconfident about their
military prospects and their
constitutional vision.
And they shut down people who tried to say
otherwise or tried to argue,
southerners that, the slavery was actually
not very good, even for, for the south.
They tried to shut down discourse And they
and and
as a result, they basically shot
themselves in the, the foot.
They in the same way that Much of tyrants
over
the course of world history have basically
made fundamental miscalculations because
they shut down information flows because
they just didn't want to
hear things that were at all critical of,
of their opinions.
And,
and when you shut down information flow
you actually weaken your society
in some very important ways.
This is the long term strength, it seems
to me of open free democratic cultures So
here's
the story of how we eventually get the
radical 13th Amendment.
Lincoln gets elected despite the 12th
Amendment.
The south succeeds by force of arms.
And they put up a pretty good military
show and so eventually
Lincoln is forced as a military measure,
to issue the emancipation.
And as a diplomatic measure, the
Emancipation Proclamation.
His initial
proposal is simply, come back to the
Union.
I am, I won't tinker with, with slavery in
the states, you know.
My, I'm going to stand on my platform
of excluding slavery from the western
territories.
But that's not really going to prejudice
your economic interests in any immediate
way.
So and I promise that I'm not going to
mess with slavery in the
states and if you'll like, I'll support a
constitutional amendment to that effect.
So, that's what Lincoln
says in his inaugural address that a very
different kind of 13th Amendment.
But the south spurns that deal, Lincoln is
initially just trying to bring them back
in.
But
after the war proceeds in the fall of
1862, he issues his preliminary
Emancipation Proclamation which, as
a war measure, is going to provide for the
freeing of certain slaves in, in the rebel
territories.
Now why does he do that?
Again, it's as a war measure.
Two ideas.
One, he's worried as Diplomat-In-Chief.
Remember the foreign policy and
geo-strategic
considerations the President has to keep
in mind, because the Constitution's very
much about a national security and
geo-strategy.
He's worried that England, that Britain
might recognize the Confederacy.
They have certain economic interests.
Southern cotton feeds and fuels British
textile mills.
And so.
And Britain doesn't
care about American Union as such.
Britain had fought against the American
Revolution.
Had fought America in the war of 1812.
You know, has its own territories in
the New World, Canada, and, and, and
elsewhere,
and, and might not like, nothing better,
maybe,
from a certain Imperial British point of
view.
That have the American, former American
colonies sort of divided against
themselves, so Britain can play this
classic divide and conquer game.
So if it's just a war about American
Union, maybe Britain sides with the south.
But if it's a war to end slavery, if
Lincoln
can redefine the meaning of the war, war
originally fought
for Union, but now Lincoln, with the
emancipation, redefines it
as a war for freedom, for the end of
slavery.
British public opinion will not allow
Britain to side with the South.
Textile workers even in,
in Britain at the risk of their own jobs,
will actually support Lincoln's
vision, and will oppose any British effort
to recognize the Confederacy.
So there's a foreign policy dimension to
the Emancipation Proclamation.
Keep England out of, of, of America, just
as the, revolution
had been designed to sort of kick England
out, keep them out.
And, there's a
more immediate war and if you take all
of the southern man power represented by
the slaves.
That they're propping up the plantations,
they're freeing up labor.
If they, if they work in the fields, then
they're freeing
up masters and overseers, white labor to,
to fight on the battlefields.
So they're helping the south.
as, and, and for
its basic economic base.
If you, if all those slaves instead stop
helping the south and actually
join the northern cause and maybe some of
them join the Union army.
Well, that's a lot of manpower to take
from one
pan of the scale and put it to the other.
And Lincoln thinks that might very well be
the margin of victory.
And it turns out he's right, it's 180,000
blacks in blue.
End up, fighting former slaves and their
kinfolk
in, in, the Union in places like,
Kentucky.
Flock to the Union lines, you have all
that
manpower that had been supporting the
Confederacy in effect,
and now it's supporting the Union cause
and that's
the margin of victory in, in some
important respects.
This will help a strategy that will
culminate with smashing
victories in not just places like
Gettysburg and Vicksburg but in
Atlanta.
And Lincoln wins re-election.
And when he wins re-election, some of you
have seen the movie Lincoln, he uses
his renewed mandate to push through a 13th
Amendment, that's going to say, slavery
must end everywhere.
And this is radical.
Not just in the former Confederacy, but
even in Union states like Kentucky and
Maryland and Delaware, Missouri.
West Virginia has also sort of joined the
Union during this time period.
So, slavery has to end everywhere.
Not just for rebel masters, but even
for loyal Union masters in places like
Kentucky.
So it has to end everywhere.
Immediately, now, not in 20 years or 50
years, or 100 years.
Slavery ends now, immediately and there's
no compensation.
And a later provision of the 14th
Amendment will actually say it's going to,
it's actually illegal for a government
state,
or federal to compensate the slave
masters.
So, immediate universal, uncompensated
emancipation of a
sort that no state had ever adopted
before the Civil War.
This is, this is, this is a radical moment
in American history.
Made possible only because, actually, the
south so overplayed its hand.
Generating a huge backlash.
and, and resulting in the, the, the
carnage and cataclysm of Civil War
without that, you would have never had the
13th Amendment in the form.
It, it was not some gradual
fulfilment of the deep spirit of the
founders who put America on a,
on a proper future course even
though they, they didn't eliminate slavery
themselves.
That would be a nice story to tell, but
that's not how it happened.
The founders messed up on slavery, they
created a
pro-slavery system that got worse and
worse and worse.
This cancer, and the cancer became so bad
it almost killed the patient and
radical measures were needed as a result,
and Lincoln was able to do that
only because the Civil War, only because
the south was dumb enough to secede,
frankly.
So that's the story of the 13th Amendment,
and it
ends with the, it says, no slavery shall
exist anywhere.
And that means actually if, if a private
person tries
to enslave another individual that
governments are obliged to intervene.
This is a radical provision.
It has no government
action requirements.
It limits even private parties.
It requires government to act, to free
people from slavery.
And there are all sorts of forms of
slavery.
There's
agricultural slavery, there's sexual
slavery, compelled prostitution.
There's child abuse.
Some of the, if the slaves actually were,
were, were children.
There were many different forms of, of
tyranny that we
could, we could think about as as forms
of, of slavery.
And the 13th Amendment prohibits them all,
in Section 1.
And gives Congress sweeping power to
enforce
that vision in Section 2.
Remember, the Bill of Rights in the
afterglow of the American Revolution,
begin Congress which was about anxiety
about an imperial center.
So the American Revolution is localist and
the constit, Bill of Rights
that emerges says, Congress shall make no
law of a certain sort.
Enter the 10th Amendment, very states'
rightsish.
Very anti-federalist.
But now, the 13th Amendment's
going to end with the words, Congress
shall have power to enforce this.
And by the way, we're going to see that
sentence in the 14th Amendment and the
15th Amendment
too, because the Civil War is a war in
which the good guys are not the state
governments.
The colon, the colonial governments.
The seceders.
But the central government.
And, and so this new constitution is
going to emerge after the Civil War.
This new constitutional understanding is
going to be far more nationalist.
Congress shall make no law.
These are going to be amendments that in
fact limit state institutions and
practices like slavery.
Well, you might think okay once you got
rid of slavery, [NOISE] job done.
Let's move on and I think the Lincoln's
party initially
might think that and then they immediately
realize that they've miscalculated.
Do the math.
What happens once slavery ceases
to exist.
Now all these slaves become free blacks in
the south.
So, how's that going to work?
You still have the Electoral College, you
still
have the apportionment rules in the House
of Representatives.
Now all these free blacks who aren't
allowed
to vote in the south, will nevertheless
never
count in the Electoral College, count in
the
House of Representatives census, but not a
3 5ths.
because that's what, how they counted when
they were slaves.
They still counted, they still added to
the
South, Southerners' strength, but with a
discount 3 5ths.
Now that they're freed, thanks to the 13th
Amendment itself, they're going to count
at 5 5ths.
They're going to count for even more.
So, the concern is the south is going to
come back into the House of
Representatives, come back to the
Electoral College
with even more clout that they had before.
Not letting these blacks vote but getting
even more votes because
the 3 5ths has become 5 5ths, and, and so
the Republicans
immediately realized that they're going to
need at least another constitutional
Amendment.
And that Amendment is the 14th and it's
huge.
It's probably the most important feature
of our Constitution.
We're going to talk about it again and
again and
again over the course of the lectures to
follow.
So, let me just very briefly identify some
of the things that the 14th Amendment
does.
It's first sentence says
that everyone born in America is born an
American citizen.
We're all born citizens here.
We're all born equal citizens here.
Black and white, I would add male or
female, Jew or
Gentile, gay or straight because this
doesn't use the word race.
This overturns the Dred Scott case, which
said not just that slavery
had to be allowed in the territories but
also that basically free
blacks could not be citizens, and the 14th
Amendment says oh,
yes they can, constitutionally we're all
created equal, we're all born equal.
It's a constitutionalization of a radical
reading, a broad reading, Lincoln's
reading of
Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of
Independence, all men
are created equal, that's the first
sentence.
Does everyone's, an equal citizen in
America, black as well as white.
So you're not just free, it's not just
that we're ending slavery, you are a
citizen, you're an equal citizen.
The next sentence of the 14th Amendment,
no state shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens to the United
States.
So now we move from a Bill of Rights that
says Congress shall
make no law to an amendment that says no
state shall make a law.
Remember and the who misbehaved before in
the Civil War?
It's the state
governments and so now we're going to have
in effect a second Bill of Rights.
A Bill of Rights against the state
governments.
We needed a Bill of Rights against
the central government after the American
Revolution and
we got one but now we need a second Bill
of Rights against state governments.
No state shall make or enforce any law
which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States.
And note that some of the same words to
the 1st Amendment are now appearing in the
4th.
No, shall, make, law,
abridge.
That's in the 1st Amendment, that's also
in
the 14th Amendment, but now it's no state.
Now, what are these privileges or
immunities that no state shall abridge?
Fundamental things in America.
Like the Bill of Rights, like speech and
press
and petition and assembly, and free
exercise, and the right
to be free from unreasonable searches and
seizures, and due
process, and jury trials, and right of
counsel etcetera, etcetera.
These fundamental rights, freedoms,
privileges, and immunities
which had been before, been guaranteed
thanks
to the Bill of Rights against the
Feds, are now going to be guaranteed
against states.
because states had misbehaved so badly,
had shut down free speech and free press
and, and even preachers in the pulpit,
free exercise, and done all these things.
And now we need a second Bill of Rights to
make sure that they don't do that again.
So you might
say well, gee, if the 14th Amendment was
about, and this is a thing called
incorporation
of the Bill of Rights against the states,
that's what, how lawyers and judges talk
about it.
You might think, well, gee, if it's about
incorporating the Bill of
Rights against states, why is it to say a
Bill or Rights?
And the answer is because, it's about more
than just a Bill of Rights,
it's about other enumerated rights and
freedom,
the privileged of writ of habeas corpus.
Proof beyond reasonable doubt all sorts of
other fundamental things and the
right to testify in your own behalf of the
as a criminal defendant.
And all sorts of other fundamental rights
and freedoms.
So it's even more than the Bill of Rights,
and the phrasing that they used
was apt, privileges and immunities of
citizens, because,
remember, the Constitution doesn't call
these early amendments,
a Bill of Rights.
We do today but, but that's [UNKNOWN]
large part because the
framers of the 14th Amendment called them
the Bill of Rights.
The founders, not so much.
The Supreme Court never referred to the
early Amendments
as a Bill of Rights before the Civil War.
They did refer to these amendments as
privileges and immunities of citizens,
and so the 14th Amendment says, states
can't mess with these things.
And you might say, well, if states can't
mess with these
things, why did they say due process in
the next sentence, or
the next clause?
because isn't due process a privilege or
immunity alread that
already is covered, so why a separate
mention of due process?
And the answer is, the due process
clause protects persons above and beyond
citizens.
The only folks protected by that first
privileges or immune ideas are citizens,
but, but the framers of the 14th
Amendment thought persons deserve
protection as well.
And they also said,
persons deserve equal protection and due
process.
now, here's one thing the 14th Amendment
didn't do.
It didn't guarantee a right to vote.
You might say, well, why isn't voting a
privilege or immunity of citizens?
Well, remember in Article IV, way back
when, when I go to I'm a Connecticut
person, to New York, I get all sorts of
Civil rights, but not a right to vote.
Or to serve on a jury.
So political rights under Article IV were
seen as
not covered under privileges or immunities
of inter-state citizenship.
Nor are they covered by the 14th
Amendment, which is about privileges
and immunities of citizenship that I have
against my own home government.
Not just when I go to New York, but
against Connecticut.
I have certain rights, speech, press, and
so on, but the
14th Amendment doesn't quite give me a
right to vote, yet.
Today,
courts say equal protection gives you a
right to vote.
It's not so clear that it originally,
that's
what was intended, because remember, equal
protection is about
persons as distinct from citizens, and
aliens especially, and
then they've never had a right to vote
before.
And that's why all the framers of the 14th
Amendment, actually,
to a person, to a man, said this isn't
about voting rights.
This is about Civil rights as opposed to
voting rights.
And why did they insist
on that?
because they didn't have the votes at the
time to get a voting rights amendment
through.
But they will, just shortly thereafter,
with the
15th Amendment, get a voting rights
amendment through.
How are they able with the 15th Amendment
to get
through what they weren't able to do in
the 14th Amendment.
And the answer is, the 14th Amendment did
have some
rules about voting.
And the rules about voting, which are in
Section 2 said, if you don't let
basically,
black people vote, then you get fewer
seats
in the House of Representatives in the
Electoral College.
And then the framers of the 14th Amendment
didn't want.
So, so as a practical matter, that was
really going to penalize the South because
it had a lot of black people and not so
much the North, which had,
which had fewer.
And the framers of the 14th Amendment did
one other thing.
They said, we're not going to let the
Southern governments
back into the the, the, the House of
Representatives and
the Senate, until they promise to let
black people
vote, and in fact until they ratify the
14th Amendment.
You might say, well, why was that okay?
And that's because, basically the southern
governments were unRepublican,
they were not, they didn't have free
speech, they didn't
have free press, they weren't letting
black people vote, black people, were
a majority in some of the southern states
a huge plurality in others.
And, and, so it just, wasn't, once these
slaves become free, you can't prevent them
from voting.
If they're slaves, that's one thing.
It's like aliens can't vote but once an
alien becomes
a citizen, it's very different to prevent
them from voting.
Once these slaves become free, it's very
different to prevent them from voting.
Yes, some Northern states prevented blacks
from voting but that was
a small percentage of the population say,
the Republicans, 1, 2%.
Whereas in the South, it's 60%, 50%, 40%,
35%,
it's much different to exclude, a huge,
population base.
So how do you get the 15th Amendment?
Once you impose black suffrage on the
South, then they come back into Congress
and they these new Congress people will
support an amendment to constitutionalize
that everywhere,
to have black suffrage in the North too.
And that's the 15th Amendment.
Now who's upset by all of this?
Among others, women, they're saying, why
are you enfranchising
black people before some of them are
illiterate, many of
whom are illiterate, why are they, why are
poor illiterate
black men getting the vote before
Radcliffe and Smith educated
white women?
And there are a couple of arguments.
One is that blacks fought on the
battlefield and, and voting rights are
connected to to arms bearing.
And another is, you can count on men to
protect the women in their lives.
When the men vote, they'll protect their
wives and mothers and daughters and
sisters.
But you can't count on whites to protect
blacks.
So, we're going to come back to that story
and
the women are not quite mollified by these
stories.
So they're going to, once we have an
amendment that says, in the 15th
Amendment.
No abridgement of voting rights on account
of race,
women are going to say, let's add sex to
that.
And that's going to be a story that we're
going to
come back to in, in the next couple of
lectures.
But I'm going to end this one by once
again reminding
you of the, of the image in the
accompanying
chapter of America's Constitution: A
Biography, it's Chapter 10.
Shall I trust these men.
This is Lady Columbia, America.
Shall I trust these men.
These former Confederates.
They want sort of back in, shall I let
them back in.
Robert Lee and others.
Shall I trust these men?
And not this man.
A black man who's
lost his limb in service of America.
He's wearing a Union coat and, and Uni, a
Union uniform.
Black man win
rights.
ult, ultim, initially
rights to be free.
Later rights to be an equal
citizen and eventually rights to be an
equal voter, because they
fight and bleed for the Union on the
battlefield of glory.
Denz, remember the story with Denzel
Washington and Matthew
Broderick in the, in that movie, The
Massachusetts 54th.
So once again here, we see deep
connections
of the three great themes of American
history.
Democracy.
Democracy is being expend, extended to
those to,
to black men.
National security, in part because of a
war, a war that gives
them a chance to shine and show their,
their stuff, their, their virtue.
So national security and democracy, and
the story of, of slavery, but now we move
from an, a pro-slavery constitution before
the war
to an emphatically anti-slavery
constitution after the war.
That's the great reconstruction.
That's the, the constitution we live in
today.
Now, Lady Columbia is, is a female
embodiment and as I
said many she's personified here as white,
many women are not very happy.
That, that they're being cut out of this
deal.
There's going to be another great war in
America at
the beginning of the 20th Century, World
War I.
And women
are going to get their vote in that war
and because of that war.
And so the national security story that we
see here that we saw
at the founding, and that we see in the
Civil War will continue.
And that's the story among others of the
next two lectures, so please stay tuned.
