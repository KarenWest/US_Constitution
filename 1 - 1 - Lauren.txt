Hello.
My name is Lauren Bizacky and I am a third
year law student here at Yale University.
I, along with the other teaching
assistants, had the pleasure of
taking Professor Amar's consititutional
law class while we were students here.
And we are thrilled to be able to explore
these
same ideas and concepts with you in this
online platform.
Now each week, Professor Amar will give
you lectures that follow
the course of two books.
America's Constitution, a Biography, and
America's Unwritten Constitution.
Each week you'll cover two different
chapters from these textbooks
and really dig in to the Constitution's
text and history.
Now in addition to these lectures, you'll
also have the opportunity
to engage with your other classmates in
the online discussion forum.
The online discussion forum
is a place where you can go to post links,
to ask questions, to engage
in debate, and to really dig in to
the materials that you'll discuss in the
lectures.
I look forward to being your teaching
assistant.
And I know that we're going to have a
great experience with this course.
