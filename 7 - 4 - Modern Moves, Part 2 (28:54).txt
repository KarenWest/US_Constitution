Welcome back.
We're up to the set of amendments in the
1960s the most recent, really, set of
amendments and the 23rd and 24th
Amendments.
Fit very nicely into our general story.
The 23rd Amendment brings the District
of Columbia into the Electoral College
System.
Remember the Electoral College System is
one
in which different states are assigned
electoral votes based on their population.
Originally pegged connected to the 3/5ths
clause, but with
the end of slavery, the 3/5ths clause is
dropped away.
But the Electoral College System is one in
which states
are basically are the, the
fundamental units for determining
presidential elections.
And the 23rd Amendment says, well, we're
going to allow DC to be part of that
Electoral College System.
It's not going to be a state for the House
of Representatives.
It's not going to be a state for the
Senate, but we are going to allow it
to, to have a few electoral votes, as, as
if it were a state in effect.
And the 24th Amendment is going to end
prohibits
poll taxes.
In states being used to
prevent people from voting in federal
elections.
And for the, for example, for the Senate,
for the House of Representatives, for the
Presidency.
The Supreme Court is going to take in the
same era, the
1960s, some of the deep animating
principles underlying that 24th amendment.
And actually say, gee, not only should
there be no poll taxes for federal
elections,
there should be no poll
tax disfranchisement for state elections
either.
So, how you might ask, does that fit into
the general story thus far?
Remember the general story thus far has
been a
story of democracy, national security, and
slavery slash race.
So let's take the District of Columbia.
Here's one thing you need to understand
about
D.C. There's a very substantial proportion
of non-whites
who live in D.C. If African-Americans
that's true today,
has been true for the last 150 years at
least.
Remember early on, the district from
before Abraham Lincoln's Presidency
the District of Columbia is actually a
slave holding jurisdiction.
It's it's part of, it's on the boarder
between
Virginia and Maryland both of which were
slave states.
When the Civil War broke out.
So there are a lot of black people who
live in D.C. and when you bring D.C. into
the Electoral College System
you are advancing democracy.
And actually the cause of racial justice.
And, democracy is itself a part of the
process.
It's not just the result of D.C being
brought in, but it's part of the process.
We've been talking about party
competition, presidential parties.
Both parties support the Republicans and
the Democrats support
this move to bring D.C. into the Electoral
College fold.
And that's because in the middle of the
20th century, both the Republican and the
Democrat party are vying for the
allegiance of African-Americans actually.
Before, FDR, blacks very reliably vote
Republican party
Lincoln before 1932.
After 1972 after sort of
the African Americans overwhelmingly vote
democrat.
But between 1932 and 1972, so the black
vote is kind of up for grabs.
Both political parties
are, are trying to get it.
Blacks are a swing Democratic a
swing demographic, excuse me,
constituency, maybe like.
Hispanics are at the beginning of the 21st
century.
So FDR has won a bunch of black votes and
Truman is, has desegregated
the armed forces and, and, and when he
runs for election in his own right.
It's the black vote that's the margin of
victory.
Had Dewey, Thomas Dewey, who ran against
him, actually won the African
American vote, Dewey would indeed have
beaten Truman and won the presidential
election.
Eisenhower's trying to win back the black
vote, and and both Nixon
and Kennedy in 1960 are vying for it.
For the black vote and
D.C is kind of part of that
whole conversation about African Americans
more generally.
And the 23rd Amendment is proposed under
Ike and ratified under
JFK and I think it's a nice symbol of some
of these issues.
Now how does national security.
Factor into this.
So we talked about democracy and we talked
about race.
National security figures in,
in part because there's not just a
domestic audience when
it comes to race relations in America, but
an international audience.
We're in the middle of a cold war and
the Soviet Union is having a propaganda
field day.
In Africa and Asia.
That's, that's the battlefield of cold
war.
We're trying to win the cold war for the.
We're trying to win the hearts and
minds of brown skinned and black-skinned
and yellow-skinned
people in Africa, and Asia, and South
America.
And the Soviet Union is saying, oh, the
United
States doesn't practice what it preaches,
it has segregation.
It has discrimination.
Look, it's the national capital, it has a
bunch of black people.
And they don't even get to vote fairly in
presidential elections.
And the 23rd Amendment is, you know,
trying to actually say to the
rest of the world, no, actually, we are
trying to solve our racial problems.
Now you might say,
well D.C. was never in the Electoral
College System.
It's not about race, it's just the
Constitution has different rules for it's
territories.
And that made a certain amount of sense at
the
founding D.C wasn't part of the Electoral
College System but
neither were the territories and there
were a lot of
territories and a lot of people lived in
the territories.
But as the territories gradually became
states.
Admitted on equal footing.
Remember the story that we told thus far.
There are states, and the new states the
territories.
The west wasn't being treated as a
permanent western colony of the east
coast.
As those territories became states.
It's an increasingly anomalous that D.C
was left behind.
So D.C, you know, was left out of
the system even as the territories became
states.
And at the time that, that anomaly became
increasingly clear, when the west, the,
the frontier ended.
And Wyoming, and Arizona, and
the other western states are finally
coming in.
D.C.'s status seemed increasingly
anomalous, and people started to notice.
A lot of black people are living there
now.
And so, so D.C being brought into the fold
is part of a larger geo-strategic story.
Remember, at the same time that this is
happening.
Hawaii is becoming a state, the 50th
state.
Hawaii Five-O.
Alaska is becoming the 49th state,
projecting
beyond the continental lower 48, the
contiguous lower.
48th, and there's a national security
story there.
We want to project power after World War
Two, into the
Pacific, Pearl Harbor, you know, was a
scene of military disaster.
But we have to project power into the
Pacific Rim toward Japan,
Alaska, borders on Siberia, The Soviet
Union.
We want listening posts close to The
Soviet Union.
Remember also Alaska has a pretty
substantial proportion of non whites,,
Aleuts.
Native Americans.
Hawaii has a very large percentage of non
whites.
So Alaska and Hawaii and D.C are all part
of a story of the Cold War of race.
But also of increasing democracy.
This is also the era, the 1960s, that's
going to
give us an Immigration Reform Act, that's
going to make
it possible for people from Africa and
Asia and
South America increasingly to come to the
United States.
And this is part of a Cold War idea, we
want to
be open to the talent of all the rest of
the world.
And D.C. is part of that, that larger
story.
Now
D.C. is still not quite given full
treatment.
It's not in the House of Representatives.
It's not, doesn't have two senators, it's
not admitted as a state.
And I'm not predicting, necessarily that,
that will happen.
soon, because that the window of special
opportunity, I think, closed to some
extent.
In the middle of the 20th century because,
remember what I said.
Blacks are politically in play.
There are swing constituency between 1932
and 1972.
And they make a lot of progress in
part because both political parties are
vying for them.
Much as earlier political parties didn't
want to offend women, and so
at a certain point, both basically said,
oh, we're for women's suffrage.
Well, now when blacks are in play both
parties are, are wooing them.
But after 1972, blacks have quite reliably
members
of the Democratic coalition, and not at
all clear
that Republicans would support D.C.
statehood.
For example, because that's going to mean
two more Democrat Senators another one,
possibly two, members of the House Of
Representatives who would be Democrats.
So, not at all clear that Republicans
would
support more stuff for D.C today
Constitutional or
tweaks or, or full statehood.
Not at all clear that today's Republican
party would support that but
the Republican party of the middle 20th
century, the party of Eisenhower.
Did very much support that and remember
you know it's an Eisenhower
appointee, Earl Warren who, who hands down
Brown versus Board of Education.
And in fact Eisenhower's Justice
Department
supports Brown versus Board of Education.
And so so
in this period in the middle of 20th
century,
both Republicans and Democrats are
actually supporting civil rights.
and, and, and, and voting rights.
And that takes us, very naturally, to
the next amendment, which is about voting
rights.
And it's an amendment that says, states
shouldn't have poll taxes that prevent,
people, some, because they can't pay those
taxes, from voting in federal elections.
Remember, under the original Constitution,
you get to vote for The
House of Representatives if you can vote
for your State Legislature.
So state law sort of defines in the
first instance who's eligible to vote even
for Congress.
Remember, states regulate how the
presidential electors are to be selected.
It's a state-defined electorate that picks
Senators
under the 17th Amendment, the direct
election
amendment, and 24th amendment said, well,
for Federal Elections, the inability or
the
unwillingness to pay a poll tax should
never be a basis for disenfranchisement.
You should be allowed to vote whether you
pay a tax or not.
This is a grand, egalitarian republican
idea,
or small r republican, small d democrat.
Both the Republican and the Democrat party
support this amendment.
And the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court that's led by a
Republican chief justice, but has a
majority
of New Deal Democrat appointees on it, is
going to go one step further and say.
Not only should there be no pool
tax disenfranchisment for state, for
federal elections.
We shouldn't have it for state elections
either.
A republic.
A republican government, small r should be
a government of the people base republica.
The peoples thing, not the
properties thing.
Not the, it's not about money or taxes.
It's about The, the people deciding whom
they wanted to re, represent them.
And so these amendments the 23rd and the
24th are
are powerful extensions of this democracy
idea that we saw.
The founding, that carried forward through
the reconstruction that was
further elaborated by the, for example,
the direct election of Senators.
In the progressive era, so that general
story continues with these amendments.
And at the very same time that these
amendments
are being proposed republicans and
democrats in the middle.
Of the 1960's are going to get together
and pass an epic
Voting Right Act that further reinforces
the idea of Federal Protection of voting
rights implementing the grand themes of
the 14th Amendment and the 15th Amendment.
Had, to some extent, lain dormant.
because here is one thing.
[COUGH] The dirty little secret that I did
mention about poll taxes.
Poll taxes are basically used in the form
of confederacy
at when in the 1960s those were the only
states that
really had poll tax disenfrachisement,
and they probably disenfrachised blacks
disproportionately.
And and this amendment and the Supre-,
accompanying Supreme Court cases.
Extending this amendment understood all of
that.
So definitely a story of race and and the
voting rights act of 1965 following on
the heels of the civil rights act of
1964, acts supported by Republicans as
well as Democrats.
Party of Lincoln Republicans as well as
Democrats
that are trying to repudiate new democrats
the legacy.
Of the old democratic party which is about
slavery and segregation.
this, this coalition that gives you the
Civil Rights Act of' 64, the Voting Rights
act of '65 is doing so again in part with
attention to a world stage.
Trying to persuade people of good will in
Africa,
in Asia and South American that America
actually is
an open society that really does practice
what it preaches.
Which is, after the 13th, 14th, and 15th
amendments equality, which is after Direct
Election of Senators, and idea of, of
equal voting and one person one vote.
And indeed in this era the Supreme Court
is going to give us some landmark
cases which we're going to talk about much
later in, in this lecture series on
the idea of one person.
One vote.
25th Amendment, it's also about war, in
particular a
Cold War.
After President Kennedy's assassination,
Americans realized, with sort of blinding
clarity, that the rules of
presidential succession need to be
modified Yeah.
God forbid had President Kennedy been in a
coma, lingered for a long period of time,
maybe in a persistive vegetative state.
Something that, it was not entirely
clear how the, a Vice-President could
pronounce a President
sort of unable, disabled to discharge the
office and put himself forward and.
And in a Cold War with
nuclear weaponry minutes can matter.
I mean there always has to be someone
ready to take charge in between and
the original Constitution didn't have a
very
elaborate system specifying who should
declare President disabled.
It also said that if a President, did die,
and the Vice President became
President, came forward.
The Constitution didn't provide a
mechanism a,
a backup for creating a new Vice
Presidency.
So for 40 years of American history,
before
the 25th Amendment, America basically
didn't have a Vice-Presidency.
because the Vice-President had died, and
there was no way of filling that vacancy.
Or the Vice-President had resigned, and
there's no way of filling that vacancy.
Or President had died and, or,
or resigned, become disabled and the
Vice-President had moved up.
Into the presidency.
And again, there is no way to feel a
vacancy.
The 25th Amendment plugs some of those
gaps, and it's
in part motivated by Cold War reality that
minutes can
count, even seconds can count, and there
has to be
a person capable of making decisive
decisions at every moment.
And the 25 Amendment says, look if a
President dies, the Vice President
actually officially becomes President,
made that
clear, there was maybe ambiguity about
that.
That had been our tradition but the 25th
Amendment makes that very clear.
If a Vice President becomes President
because the President has died
or resigned, we can, that incoming
President can.
Fill the Vice Presidential vacancy, can
nominate
someone basically to to be the new
Vice President subject to special
Congressional confirmation process.
And if a sitting President is going to
undergo some planned surgery
or something that, like that know he's
going to be out of action.
For a while, know he's going to be
temporarily disabled.
He can provide, the, the 25th Amendment
provides a mechanism by which
he can basically officially designate the
Vice President as the person in charge and
then when he recovers take that back.
Very easily allowing seamless hand-offs of
power
back and forth between President and Vice
President.
It's a constitutionalization of the tag
team idea, the ticket idea.
The President and Vice President are going
to work very closely together.
President's are going to be picking their
Vice
President's under the 25th Amendment as as
Richard Nixon
will hand pick.
Gerald Ford when the Vice Presidency
becomes vacant, when Spiro Agnew resigns.
And Ford in turn will pick Rockefeller
when he, Gerald Ford, becomes president.
This is a kind of textualization of the
idea.
That the political, in the political party
what's emerging as
a tradition that the Presidential nominee
hand-picks his running mate.
That wasn't so clear for much of American
history but it is, it's more clear today
in political party practise and
in the text there is this close
working relationship between Presidents
and Vice Presidents.
Presidents basically pick their running
mates, their running
mates often succeed them, they're their
wing man,
and they can hand off power back and forth
in cases of, of an anticipated disability.
So let's say a planned surgery, or
something like that.
and, one of the big areas of
vulnerability.
If all this is true, we're going to talk
in
later lectures about whether the other
rules of Presidential succession.
The statutory rule makes sense.
Does it make sense if you really want
Presidents to
hand over things very easily to the next
in charge.
Does it make sense that after the Vice
President.
The next person in the statuted is the
Speaker
of the House.
Who might be a member of the other party
rather than say, the Secretary of State.
Who would be part of the same Presidential
administration.
In other words does it make sense if
something happens
to both Ronald Reagan and George Herbert
Walker Bush at
the same time, you know, would it make
sense to
have, to, if something happened to these
two republicans, have.
Democrat Tip O'Neill take over rather than
a Republican Secretary
of State.
If something happened to Obama and Biden,
would it make
sense for Boehner to take over, rather
than, say, John Kerry.
That's something we're going to come back
to in later lectures.
The 26th Amendment which is also is also
a, a product, it seems
to me, of our, our great themes of, of,
of, of race, democracy,
and national security.
The 26th Amendment says that 18 year old
get to vote.
And they have a constitutional right to
vote.
Not to be discriminated on grounds of
view.
And couple things one.
Young a, adults are, are actually in
America in recent history have been more
likely demographically to be non-white.
So, so this is actually remember
that brings more non-whites into the
process proportionately just
as getting rid of poll taxes has a racial
effect that's racially inclusionary.
It's an expansion of democracy.
Both political parties actually are, were
in favor of it so both parties were
sort of competing for the young American
vote in the way that they earlier
competed for the woman's vote or, and were
competing for the black vote in the middle
of the 20th century are now competing for
the Hispanic vote, swing constituencies.
And what's the larger story?
Obviously
Vietnam.
If 18 year old are old enough to fight and
die in Vietnam, to be drafted even against
their will,
to fight there, then they're old enough to
vote on
whether we should be in that war in the
first place.
So thought Barry Goldwater, Mr. Republican
on the right.
and, you know, Richard Nixon, a Republican
President and Democrats on the left.
It's a story that we've seen over and
over again, connections between national
security and democracy.
If you're old enough to fight, you're old
enough to vote.
Just as at the founding.
If unproperty people could fight in the
American Revolution
and they did, as, you know, loyal
militiamen and sailors
at, at places like Lexington and Concord
and Bunkers
Hill and Washingtons Army and on, on the
high seas.
If unproperty people were, you know, we
were willing to take
them and, and, and have them fight for the
patriot cause.
They should be allowed to participate and
vote in this new system.
And after the Civil War, if black men
could risk their lives and limbs for
the Union.
They should be allowed to, to vote and,
and that's the 15th Amendment.
And we, we saw that dramatic picture.
If women are really part of the the
economic a support structure for our
wars as they were in World War I.
They should be allowed to be equal voters.
Young adults, if they are fighting and
dying in Vietnam, risking their
lives and limbs, they should be allowed to
vote on that thing.
On that war, and everything else.
So the 27th Amendment, I'm not going to
say a lot about.
It was proposed actually in the founding
era,
and then gets ratified, you know 200 years
later.
It's an amendment that says that
congressional pay changes, especially
congressional pay increases.
Can't go into effect until there's been an
intervening election.
So it's a pro democracy amendment
basically saying
certain things shouldn't happen until the
people weigh in.
It's a smallish amendment, a kind of
tweak.
It's kind of interesting just because it
was
originally proposed by James Madison.
Passed the House by 2 3rds, the Senate by
2 3rds.
Not enough states ratified, but eventually
200 years later,
enough states did to put it over the top.
The story's told in more detail in the
book.
What I want to end, my lecture today, a,
with, before I talk
about this picture, remember we're always
talking about pictures, is the 28th
Amendment.
You say what?
28th Ammendment, what 28th Amendment.
Exactly, our Constitution, the end of our
Constitution, in my view, isn't the 27th
Amendment.
It's the vast creative white space.
After the 27th Amendment.
Remember, we keep adding amendments in
textual order.
The Constitution almost has a kind of
unfinished look to it.
We don't word process it and stick and,
and rewrite the thing start to finish, so
it
looks complete.
It always looks kind of incomplete.
Why 27 rather than 28 or 29 or 37?
So, the most interesting question is
what's the next amendment going to look
like.
And the amendment after that, the
amendment after that?
That, is a question for, for our
generation, and our posterity.
It's a question, my fellow citizens, for
you to ponder.
What amendment would fit the story that
we've been telling,
that would be a suit, a suitable next
chapter to this epic unfolding.
American saga and with that I think we
come to
kind of where the written constitution
ends and the unwritten begins.
One idea of an unwritten constitution is
the constitution still to be written.
The amendments of the future and the 28th
Amendment is
I think one way to really think about what
is this
story thus far?
What has been done?
What remains to be done that would be
fitting as part of this extraordinarily
inter-generational project?
Because remember, the Constitution is not
just about the founding.
It's about the amendments as well, and
those amendments
are on, you know that, that possibility
still continues.
Earlier generations made amends
for the sins of the fathers.
Their pro slavery aspects for example, the
original Constitution.
And this generation can do the same, it's
up to us.
We will talk about that a lot over the
second half of the
course when we talk actually in
rather great detail about the unwritten
constitution.
But for now, I just want to close this
lecture with this picture.
This is a picture of The March On
Washington
in 1963.
And, note how it's a continuation, really,
of the story we've told thus far.
We began chapter one with the Preamble, We
the People.
Ordinary people getting to decide how they
and their posterity would be governed.
Getting to vote, getting to deliberate,
discuss, participate.
Extraordinary.
And then we had images of freedom of
speech in debate in,
in the early Congresses.
Henry Clay speaking with Daniel Webster
and John C.Calhoun and, and the gallery.
Listening and then we talked, talked about
how in the Civil
War black men risked their lives and limbs
for the Union.
And in the process won the full rights of
political participation not
just freedom with the 13th Amendment but
Civil Equality in the 14th and
voting rights in the 15th.
And then we saw in the last chapter women
taking to
the streets and demanding full and equal
justice, demanding suffrage rights.
And the story continues here with another
group
of Americans taking to the streets to
demand freedom.
and, an end to bias.
Equal rights now,
integrated schools now.
An end to police brutality now.
Some of the demands you see, they're
almost ripped from the headlines.
Some of the same.
Issues are the issues of, of, 2013.
I'm actually giving this lecture
at a time of the 50 anniversary, really,
of the
March on Washington.
This was 1963, 50 years ago.
And and that story, ordinary people taking
to the streets, appealing to their fellow
citizens.
This is where Martin King gives that
famous, I Have a Dream, speech.
This is the day that he, he does that.
And both Republicans and Democrats are
marching.
Blacks and whites, men and women, Jews and
gentiles.
Gays and straights.
Not as many openly gay.
But some of the people actually in charge
of this march were in fact, gay, we now
know.
And they spoke, Americans listened.
The result of, of this taking to
the streets will be epic Constitutional
achievement.
Some statutory, some in the case law.
Like the Civil Rights of 6, Acts, Act of
64.
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, landmark
Warren
court opinions on just some of these
issues.
We will talk a lot more about some of that
in the second half of this course as we
explore America's unwritten constitution.
So, I hope to see you for that.
Stay tuned.
