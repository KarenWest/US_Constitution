In the lectures so far, we've been talking
a lot about the past of America's
constitution.
We're going back 225 years to the founding
era, 150 years to the Civil War era.
We've talked about the progressive era,
amendments from
the early 20th century, and the 1960s
amendments.
I'd like to conclude by inviting you to
think about the future, to envision the
future,
to think about America's unwritten
constitution in the
following way, about the constitution
still to be written.
About amendments that are yet to be
added to the constitution, former written
amendments
perhaps that will and should be added to
the constitution but aren't there yet.
Instead of looking back 225 years, let's
look ahead.
Let's imagine what the constitution should
look like in 2020, or in 2121, or in 2222.
So if we can think back 225 years,
what about if we turn the camera around,
and try to think forward 225 years.
The unwritten constitution, in the sense
of the constitution still to be written.
I'm going to try to offer a few thoughts
about what I think
the constitution of the future will look
like, and should look like.
[COUGH]
Now here are 3 principles that I'm
going to sort of put forth from the
beginning about the amendments that, that
we are likely to see and should see.
First, the amendments of the future
ideally should add
to liberty and equality, rather than
detract from it.
And why do I say that?
because the amendments thus far have done
this.
The Constitution was more democratic and
egalitarian, than what had preceded it.
It started with, it was the hinge of
history,
the big bang that created tremendous
Democratic momentum and that
momentum has carried through the
amendments, the Bill of
Rights made the system more free and equal
than before.
The Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments
ended slavery, promised equal citizenship,
black suffrage.
The Nineteenth Amendment enfranchised
women
and, the Seventeenth Amendment provided
for a more democratic [COUGH] senate, in
the progressive era.
In, in the 1960s, we got rid of poll tax
disenfranchisement.
We brought 18 year old, and young
Americans in, into the electorate.
The amendments have added to liberty and
equality thus far, and not taken away
from them, with the arguable exception of
Prohibition which was a failed
constitutional amendment.
The Eighteenth was repealed by the
Twenty-first.
So if we are to be faithful to that
constitutional
tradition we should embrace amendments
that, that, that continue that trajectory.
I've just made a methodologically
conservative argument for [UNKNOWN]
liberal amendments.
The people that gave you the constitution
and the
Bill of, and the Bill of Rights and the
Reconstruction
amendments and the progressive amendments
and the 1960s amendments were freedom
loving and liberal and egalitarian
reformers of the system.
So for example, an amendment that says,
marriage must be
between one man and one woman, well you
could have that.
You could do that but that would take away
from existing liberty and
equality where marriage is not everywhere
and always one man and one woman.
You could do that but it would be the
first amendment, with the possible
exception of Prohibition, to cut back on
liberty and equality, whereas an amendment
that says
actually people, everyone is born equal,
black
and white, male and female, whether you
are
born gay or straight and therefore gays
should have an equal right to marry
straights.
That constitutional amendment would fit a
trajectory of increased liberty and
equality.
So we could do all sorts of things.
We could get rid of the First Amendment
in, in a substantial part.
We could destroy our constitutional
project.
We could, m, have an amendment making it a
crime to burn the flag.
But that would be a limitation on the
first amendment and the
first one, really, that would be a
substantial intrusion on on
the right of Americans to, to criticize
symbols of public authority to, to
express themselves in robust uninhibited
and wide open ways politically.
So you could do this, you could destroy,
you know
the constitutional inheritance but if you
are faithful to the story
thus far I suggest amendments that add to
liberty and equality
fit the story in a way that amendments
that don't, dont.
Here's a second claim.
America's amendments of the future, are
going to, as a
practical matter, need to be embraced by
both political parties.
An amendment generally requires two thirds
of the house,
two thirds of the Senate, three fourths of
the states.
This is very hard to achieve unless both
parties are on board.
We talked about America's partisan
Constitution, it's going to
play a role in the amendment process as
well.
You can't get to two-thirds the house,
two-thirds the senate,
three quarters of the states without both
parties being on board.
And third, amendments are generally
going to reflect the state constitution
experience.
Almost everything in the US constitution
states did first.
They had written constitutions first.
In the colonial, in the, in the 17, late
1770s, early 1780s, states came up with
written constitutions.
The federal constitution mimics that.
Massachusetts and New Hampshire put their
constitution
to a vote, Federal Constitution mirrors
that.
States have 3 branches of government in
their written constitutions, Federal
Constitution mirrors that.
States except for Pennsylvania and, and
Georgia
have, have bicameral legislatures, Federal
Constitution mimics that.
Massachusetts has a strong executive and
so does New York.
Federal Constitution follows the best
state practice on that.
Pennsylvania and New York have a census,
Federal Constitution follows that.
Pennsylvania has no property
qualifications for
many oppositions, Federal Constitution
follows that.
States have Bills of Rights, the Federal
Constitution
[UNKNOWN] ,adds one because people think,
oh gee.
The absence in the Bill of Rights looks
striking
precisely because states have them on
issue after issue.
Think about the amendments.
States, many of them get rid of slavery
before the US constitution gets rid of
slavery.
Many states let Blacks vote before the US
constitution lets Blacks vote.
Many states let women vote before the US
constitution lets women vote.
On issue after issue after issue, states
are the laboratories of experimentation.
They road test certain ideas first, show
that they work
here, work in America, and then the
Federal Constitution copies them.
So 3 principles.
Add to liberty and equality at the really
Don't take
away from it, both parties have to be on
board.
States are the model, states do it first.
So concretely what amendments might you
see that would fit those 2?
I'll give you a couple of examples and
then i'll
work through the state constitutional
experience a little bit more carefully.
Let's imagine an amendment that says that
someone who was not born a
US citizen but comes to the United States
in an early age and
naturalized, becomes a US citizen and
contributes to society and is very
productive after 20 years here or 30 years
here is eligible to be president.
Today that's not the rule, if you are not
born a citizen
on your, on the day of your birth, you
can't be president.
You can be Secretary of State, you can be
on the
Supreme Court, 3 of the first 10 justices
on the Supreme Court
were foreign born and 4 of the first 6
cabinet officers for
the, Treasury Department, including
Alexander Hamilton
and Albert Gallatin were foreign born.
You can be in the House, the Senate, but
you can't
be President today, but imagine the
amendment that said that you could.
Now that amendment would add to the
breeding equality, it would expand the
birth right equality the idea of the
Fourteenth Amendment to even to
naturalized citizens.
We are all born equal, we are all created
equal, but what about people who weren't
lucky enough to have been born under our
flag, aren't you know, they worthy of
consideration?
So that amendment would add to liberty and
equality.
That amendment actually states have
[UNKNOWN] .Arnold Schwarzenegger
was governor of California and even though
he was a naturalized American.
Jennifer [UNKNOWN] of Michigan was
governor of Michigan,
even though she was born a Canadian
citizen.
Governors look a lot like presidents, I'm
going to come back to that.
4 year terms, veto pens, pardon pens,
independently elected of the legislature.
They're mini-presidents, and states have
made naturalized citizens eligible.
So states have road-tested this idea to
some important extent.
So it adds to liberty, equality, states
have road-tested it, yes, and both parties
in the future might be in favor of this,
because for every Democrat who
might be eligible, a Madeline Albright, a
Jennifer Grandholm, there's a
Republican, a Henry Kissenger, an Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and the
Republican party going forward will
eventually have to come
up with it's version of a Dream Act.
It's going to need to appeal to
Hispanics who are swing voters, to
immigrant Americans.
It can't just say no no no, it's going to
have to say yes
to something and maybe it's going to say
well we don't like the Democrat's
version of the Dream Act and we want a big
fence and we want
an electrified fence and fine, but here's
what we actually are in favor of.
You come here, you come here legally, you
come here fairly and even
though you are not born a US citizen, you
contribute after 20-30 years.
You are eligible now to be President.
The Republicans are going to say -That's
our version of the Dream Act!
And why do I say that they're going to
find it in their interest to do so?
because as a political scientist, I look
and
see that they're going to need to appeal
to that demographic coalition, or else be
doomed
to a minority status after 6 or 7 years.
because after, you know, maybe they can
win a couple more elections, but going
forward after 2020, they're going to need
to have their version of the Dream Act.
Who proposed a constitutional amendment to
let foreign born Americans
who naturalized Americans after many years
of service to be presidentially eligible?
You would be shocked to hear that it was
Orrin Hatch,
conservative Republican senator from Utah
who
proposed that constitutional amendment in
2003.
I think he probably still believes it.
I testified on behalf of that, and then
when he held hearings on that.
And Democrats supported him, imagine that.
Democrats and Republicans were actually
beginning to agree on something.
Now the Republican party more recently,
has been
very skeptical of, of, of, certain appeals
to
immigrant Americans and so Hatch has, has
kind of
put that idea on the back burner [UNKNOWN]
to worry about a Tea Party challenge, in
Utah, but I suspect deep down, he still
believes in that verse in the Dream Act
and don't be surprised if he revives it.
It fits our 3 themes.
It adds to liberty and equality.
States have road tested a version of
this idea first by allowing naturalized
citizens
to be governors; Jennifer Granholm of
Michigan,
Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and I
could
imagine easily a world in which both
parties might find it in their interests
to do this in the same way than in the
middle of the 20th century.
Who are the swing voters?
Not so much Hispanics, in the middle of
the twentieth century is Blacks.
Before 32, Blacks voted Republican in
general.
After 1972, Blacks voted Democrat in
general, but
between 1932 and 1972, they are the swing
constituency.
Both parties are appealing to them, both
Republicans and Democrats and we have a
series
of amendments and we have a series
of amendments that actually help African
Americans distinctively.
Letting young adults vote.
Young adults are disproportionately
nonwhite.
Giving some special
doing some things for DC in the electoral
college.
DC is a largely black city.
Getting rid of poll tax disenfranchisement
for certain federal elections.
This poll tax disenfranchisement that had
been used especially against African
Americans.
So between 32 and 7, 1932 and 1972,
several constitutional
amendments where both parties are vying
for the African American vote.
Well, going forward both parties are
going to be
vying for the Hispanic vote, so that's a
prediction.
You could see that, that, that amendment
because
both parties might be in favor of it.
States have road tested the idea first as
to liberty equality.
I could imagine an amendment move
abolishing the Electoral College, which
remember, is rooted in slavery moving
toward one person, one vote.
Why could I imagine that amendment?
because it, it adds to equality.
It vindicates the idea that everyone's
vote should be counted equally, whether
you're in Florida, Ohio or Wyoming or, or
California or Rhode Island.
Everyone's vote counts equally.
It's an egalitarian idea.
States have road tested this idea.
That's how we pick governors.
We don't have a little electoral college
in Texas, in California, in Pennsylvania.
Call this crazy, but here's how we do it
in each state.
We count the votes and if it's close, we
recount them carefully.
That's how, that's how we roll in New
York.
That's how we roll in Texas and states
have road tested this idea.
Both parties might be in favor of it,
because actually, left to a
college state, is not skewed in favor of
either the Republicans or the Democrats.
Yes, the electoral college ended up
helping George W Bush against
Al Gore in 2000 But in 2004 but in 2000 it
might
have helped Gore, people were predicting
the week before the election
that Gore might win the electoral vote
while losing the popular vote.
That could easily have happened.
In 2004, Kerry lost the popular vote by 3
million votes to George W Bush but if
he had carried Ohio he only lost it
by 50,000, he would have won the electoral
college.
In 2012, Barack Obama the month before the
election some people said
he could lose the popular vote and still
win the electoral vote.
The electoral college isn't skewed in
favor
of either the Republicans or the
Democrats.
Sometimes it favors the Republicans on
election day
Sometimes the Democrats just kind of, it's
like a,
a fair deck of cards with two jokers, one
red, one blue, they pop up every so often.
And the person who wins the popular vote
loses the Electoral College.
But it's not skewed Republican or
Democrat.
So I could imagine both parties actually
eventually support move to one person, one
vote.
So both parties might support it, it's
possible.
because the current system doesn't favor
either party.
And it adds to equality.
It vindicates one person, one vote, which
is an egalitarian idea, a Warren Court
idea.
And states have road tested this, in
effect, by the way they, they pick
Governors.
By the way, the reason the electoral
college doesn't really favor either party.
Democrats tend to win most of the biggest
states, 7 of the 10 biggest states,
6 of the 10 biggest states and because of
winner take all, that's a huge bonus.
So they win most of the big states,
Republicans tend to win more
states over all especially states that
have low populations, big and in those low
population states get extra electoral
votes because
every state has a minimum of 3,
no matter how few people it has, it has 2
senators and a representative.
So because of that Republicans win more
states, so they have a
little bit of an advantage that way,
Democrats win more big states.
Winner take all and these two basically,
roughly balance out.
These 2 countervailing biases basically
balance out.
That won't always be true in American
history.
It hasn't always been true.
But right now is a particularly
interesting window for possible
reform, because, I think the current
system doesn't favor either party.
So, both parties might be open to it.
And book chapter of America's unwritten
Constitution when
I talk about this, I'll also explain how
we could get to move to direct election
of the presidency without a formal
Constitutional amendment.
I am not going to be able to go into
that here but if you are interested check
out the chapter.
It turns out they're, they're, it's not
just one way of doing it.
There are several ways, in fact of moving
to
direct election of the presidency without
a formal constitutional amendment.
Now remember my 3 principles.
Both parties are going to need to be on
board.
Ideally we should have, thinking of
amendments that add to liberty and
equality.
And states have to road test ideas first.
Let me come back to that third idea.
Let's look at state constitutions more
carefully, and take
a look at the ideas that they road tested.
because here's what's amazing.
When you look at the 51 American
constitutions,
the one Federal Constitution, the 50 state
constitutions.
We find strikingly, there really is an
American way of doing things.
American exceptionalism, if you will.
In 10 different ways, virtually all our
constitutions, state and federal,
are quite similar to each other, there's a
kind of a basic
American model, in ways that make us
different from at least one or, more
major advanced constitutional democracies
sort of elsewhere in the world.
So they're a whole bunch of things where
all the, or virtually
all the American constitutions, fifty one
of them, look pretty much the same.
Then what is really interesting is, on
each one of those
similarities it turns out some states,
some or many of the
states have varied a little bit form how
the federal government
does it which creates all sort of
interesting possibilities for reform.
So, let me tell you the 10 similarities.
So, written constitutions.
50 state constitutions are all written.
Federal Constitution.
All of these constitutions reflect some
special idea of popular sovereignty, above
and
beyond an ordinary legislature just
passing an
ordinary statute and calling it a
constitution.
Now that makes our system, that's every
state that's the Federal Government, that
makes our
system different than England that doesn't
have
a written constitution or Israel for that
matter.
Virtually all the 51 have bills of rights
that are typically in a separate
section of the document and are judicially
enforced Wasn't true of Britain til
recently.
Wasn't true of Australia for example.
third, bicameral legislatures.
2 branches, except in, in Nebraska with
fixed legislative terms, not to a variable
term.
In England, basically it's a one branch.
It's pretty much House of Commons in the
legislature and it's not a fixed term
it actually can can vary, you don't know
exactly when election day is going to
occur.
Anytime there's a vote of no confidence
you can have an early election if the
opposition causes the downfall of the
ruling coalition, the ruling
coalition can call an early elections
called the snap election if it
thinks that the, that, it, it, if there's
an advantage of doing so.
That's not our,
system.
But our system is bicameralism fixed
legislative terms.
now, we have single, in the fourth
similarity, single member districts.
In most of the state legislatures, with
2 parties, not a proportional
representative system.
The same 2 parties everywhere pretty much
Democrats and Republicans.
That's different than multi party systems
that you see in a lot of other countries,
Italy, Israel, New Zealand, Germany, they
have proportional representation
systems, that's not quite what we have.
We've got a strong presidentialist system,
with all 50 states have
a governor who's elected independently of
the legislature, and serves a fixed term.
It's not like a parliamentary system where
in England
or, or other, other places where the
legislature picks the,
the head of the executive branches, not
sort of
our system at the state level, or the
federal level.
Sixth, we have a constitutionally
specified
Presidential executive understudy, the,
the Vice President.
Lieutenant governors in most states that's
just not true of who has sort of his own
term of office 4 years typically just as
governors are typically 4 years.
And, and governors, by the way, have
pretty much
very similar powers to presidents, a veto
pan, a
pardon pan, this lieutenant governor or
vice president has
a constitutionally specified office, he's
the next in line constitutionally.
That's not true in a parliamentary system.
If something happens to the prime
minister, there's not someone who's
officially predesignated
always as in the constitution as the
person who will be next in line.
We've got a system of judicial review in
which every court
can enforce the Constitution, the state
constitution and the Federal Constitution.
That's not true in a lot of parts of the
world that have
one and only one court called
the Constitutional Court that enforces the
constitution.
We've got a particular blend of judicial
independence and political
accountability, that's very different than
the way the rest of the world, much of the
rest of the world picks judges we've got a
system of Common law adjudication
where state and federal courts all have
certain powers
to, to recognize rights and legal rights
and duties
on their own, by creating a thing called a
kind of judge
made law called common law, juries are an
important part of our system.
That's not true in all the rest of the
world, it's not
true for example, the rest of the world
has a common law system.
France doesn't.
So, 10 profound similarities between the
state constitutions and the Federal
Constitution.
There is an American way of doing things.
A basic American model, American
exceptionalism.
Now my final lecture, I'm going to take
you back
to that list of 10, and show you how on
each one of those similarities, at least
one state,
maybe a bunch of states actually does
things slightly differently.
And that's going to create really
interesting
set of reform questions for the future.
When states do it a little differently
than the Federal Government, here's the
question.
Should states change their policies and
conform more tightly to the federal model?
Or should the federal model actually be
modified to,
to line up with what the states are doing.
Or can we tell some sort of story that
we already live in the best of possible
worlds.
It is good that the federal government and
the
states do things differently because they
have slightly different functions.
But now we have a really interesting set
of issues that we have for the
constitution of the future that I'm going
to explore with you in the next lecture.
By looking carefully at the State
laboratories,
the State experiments, we can try to think
about what possible future Federal
reforms, or
State constitutional reforms, might be in
the cards.
So that's what we're going to do in the
final lecture of, of from this book.
Stay tuned.
