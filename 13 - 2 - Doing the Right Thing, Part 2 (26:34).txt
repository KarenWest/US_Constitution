Welcome back.
We're talking about the role of conscience
in our system of government.
And in particular, we're focusing on at,
at this precise point in, in the
conversation, we're focusing on the
ability of
jurors to give voice to their conscience.
In particular, we're talking about the,
the right, I'm going to argue that it is a
right, and
power of jurors to acquit against the
evidence, to just say no.
To refuse in the federal criminal justice
system.
To just say no.
And the state criminal justice system for
that matter.
To just say no to criminal punishment that
they think is unconscionable.
It's just too savage.
And they do refuse to participate in, in
this kind of savagery.
And so let's imagine for example that the,
the statute on the book says well anyone
who
steals a slice of pizza or a baseball
glove or a, a golf club.
If he has two prior offenses well, this is
his third strike
and he has to go to prison for the rest of
his life.
And let's imagine that it's pretty clear.
There's a video camera and it shows he's
taking a slice of
pizza out there without having paid or, or
the baseball glove or
the, the golf club and and you're on the
juror, the jury and he did it.
He's guilty but you really wonder whether
he deserves life imprisonment for that.
Whether that punishment really, genuinely
fits the crime.
Do you have the right and power to acquit,
acquit
against the evidence, because the evidence
suggests that he's guilty.
This is the issue of, of what what critics
call jury, jury nullification.
It has a long history in the
Anglo-American
world going all the way back to the 1670s.
In England the case called Bushel's case a
jury
simply refused to convict and the judges
tried to
actually punish the jury for that and the
ruling
eventually came down though that they
couldn't do that.
Jurors can acquit against the evidence and
and can't be punished for that.
In America a case involving a man named
Zenger.
He was on trial in New York in the 1730s.
He had, had published some items critical
of the government.
And the law said that that was a crime but
the jury, jury
very famously, in the Zenger case simply
said well we're not going to convict.
And he went free because you can't,
basically in America,
hold someone in convict someone if a juror
just, if a juror, jury just says no.
Blackstone who we encountered earlier in,
in, in this
course referred to a practice that he
called pious perjury.
It was a certain kind of perjury, a false
swearing, but it
was kind of pious, it was admirable.
Here's, here's how it worked in England,
in England if you stole an item worth
more than a pound, that was grand larceny
and that was a death penalty offense.
But if the item you stole was worth less
than a pound, that was petty larceny.
And, and it wasn't a, a death penalty
because you get, you'd get shipped
off to, to Australia or Georgia, but you,
we, you, they wouldn't, they wouldn't
hang you.
And the question of how much the va-,
value of the
items stolen was worth was basically a
question for the jury.
And in all sorts of cases, you, a person
stole a horse.
And the horse is worth way more than a
pound.
But the jury basically came back with
a verdict of petty larceny, not grand
larceny.
They just said we think that this horse
wasn't worth more than a pound.
and,
and of course they know that the horse was
worth more than a pound.
What they really were doing is saying the
guy is guilty.
He deserved some punishment.
But not this savage a punishment.
Not death, something, you know, less
harsh, less savage than that.
And Blackstone referred to this, as I said
as, as pious perjury.
It was, it was
a certain kind of false swearing.
They were saying the guy was innocent of,
of grand larceny when he was guilty.
But it was done for kind of admirable
reasons.
There was a certain merciful component
here piety.
They're not allowed to convict when the
person is innocent.
They're allowed to acquit when the person
is guilty.
Note the asymmetry here.
Less punishment is okay
than the law authorizes.
Never more.
Now you might say okay, well but is that
really a power in America.
Why is it a power in America?
Because once the jury says no, you can't
retry the defendant.
Double jeopardy kicks in.
Jeopardy is attached.
A jury acquittal means that once the
verdict comes in the defendant is quit.
He's done.
That's what an acquittal is.
He's, he's, he's, it's, it's over.
But there are several other.
So there's a power, a raw power of jurors
to do
this, but I would say not just a power, a
right, because
there are several technical doctrines in
our law that really reflect
the right of the jury to say no, even
against the evidence.
On the civil side, if the evidence is
absolutely clear, that the, the defendant
is guilty, is liable to the, the plaintiff
for damages, the
judge can simply just order, if you can
call it summary judgement.
Can basically say judgement for the
plaintiff.
Judges are not allowed to do that in a
criminal case.
In a civil case even a, a judge can direct
the jury.
Can tell the jury, you must con, find the
defendant
liable to the plaintiff.
Judges are not allowed to do that in the
criminal
case, and in the criminal side, only in
the civil side.
After a jury has come back in a civil
case,
with a judgment for the defendant, a judge
can set that
aside actually and order a new trial, or
actually it's called
judgment notwithstanding, the, the, the
verdict can basically overturn a jury
that sides with a civil defendent.
A judge can overturn that, on the civil
side, not on the criminal side.
So there are a whole bunch of rules in the
criminal justice system
that guarntee if a defendant wants a jury
he can get a jury.
And if the jury and the judge can't tell
the jury that it must convict
and the judge can't when the jury comes
back with an acquittal can't undo that
in anyway.
Done is done.
Double jeopardy acquittal.
These doctrines reflect not merely the raw
power of juries to
acquit, but fundamentally their, their
rights to do so as part
of our special system protecting liberty
in the federal criminal justice
system and protecting the role of juror
conscience in this system.
We want ordinary people to participate in
the process.
And
and we want them to feel good about the
system afterwards.
And do, will they feel good about the
system if they're
being asked to do things that they think
are deeply unconscionable?
To, to send people to very savage
punishments that they think really aren't,
aren't warranted.
Are ordinary people gong to want to
participate in the system if that's the
case?
So our system actually allows jurors to
just say no.
But here's the kicker.
It doesn't tell
jurors that.
There is this right and power of
jury nullification, but jurors aren't told
about this.
And it's a very, it's a scary power.
It's a dangerous power.
It can be used for bad things.
Yes, in the Zenger case, the jury stood up
for freedom of speech and of the press.
And yes, in Bushel's case, the jury
actually was siding with
a very sympathetic defendant who actually
happened to be William Penn.
They if, of, of the proprietor of later to
be the proprietor of Pennsylvania, the,
the colony of Pennsylvania.
And that was a case about,
involving certain religious liberty and
other things.
But, but, so there is a grant and yes,
sometimes jurors can
be very merciful, and we think that was,
that was a generosity there.
A bigness of heart.
But in America jury nullification has also
been used for very bad purposes.
Klansmen, thugs have killed or maimed
black people.
And all white juries just said, well we're
not going to convict for that.
You know, we're going to let you get away
with murder, get away with rape.
We're going to let you lynch people and
we're going to look the other way.
We're going to acquit against the
evidence.
A very famous case in the 1950s involved
a, a young,
a black youth named Emmett Till.
And he was savagely murdered for
making a, an inappropriate sexual gesture,
a
pass at a, a white woman.
And he was brutally
killed and an all white jury acquitted
the, the murderers within an hour.
And basically said, oh if we hadn't
actually stopped to
drink a soda pop, it wouldn't have taken
us that long.
So jury nullification is a two-edged
sword.
It has been used for bad purposes in
America as well as
good purposes, but it is a right and power
of the jury.
And my suggestion is that jurors should be
told about it.
We should take jury nullification and
bring it out of the shadows.
Bring it into the open there.
Judges should tell jurors about this
power, tell
jurors about how it's been used, you know,
admirably in American history, the Zenger
case.
How it's been used in disgraceful
situations, and, and try to
give them some, some guidance about when
it's appropriate and when not.
In effect, just like we Mirandize
defendants and
explain to them their rights against
compelled self-incrimination.
We could Zenger-ize and Till-ize would-be
jurors and tell them about this.
See he, if you've, if you've seen this
movie you actually now know about jury
nullification.
If you've, if you read the book
chapter you'll know even more about jury
nullification.
But if you don't know that and you just
come in and your
summoned to jury service, you might have
kind of slightly confused ideas about
this.
You, you, you might not know about it at
all.
And, and some jurors might know about it,
and others not.
And, and that's not what the system is
about.
The system is about using jury service as
a way of reconnecting
the citizens with their constitution, of
enlisting your conscience, of making
you feel actually that you are a citizen
in a self-governing republic.
And actually you and, and there's not just
one of you.
There are a bunch of you and you're
talking
together and deliberating in a morally and
legally serious way.
Our system doesn't do that today.
It should.
Now, there are probably going to need to
be
some other reforms if we move down this,
this
road.
I think it may very well be that jurors
and, and by the way how to avoid the
Emmett Till situation I think the biggest
key is making sure that our jurors really
reflect America.
The problem in the Till case was really
that it was an all white jury.
Because blacks were excluded from jury
service at the time.
They weren't allowed to vote.
illegally, in violation of the Fifteenth
Amendment in much of the the deep south.
This is a case that came out of the south
in 1950s.
They weren't allowed to vote.
They weren't allowed to serve on juries.
When you have all white jurors, and that
exclude
other folks, you're going to get,
sometimes, verdicts like this.
So I think the key is to bring everyone
in.
Everyone onto the jury.
To have it be genuinely a cross-section
reflecting America.
But if we do do that as a
practical matter, maybe jurors aren't
going to be unanimous.
It's going to be hard to insist that if we
really bring in all the
diversity of America it may be hard to
expect them to always, to agree on things.
At the founding, jurors were unanimous but
that's because lots of folks were
excluded.
Unpropertied people African Americans
women.
In a more diverse society if everyone
comes onto
the jury, it may not be reasonable to
expect that the juries are going to be
unanimous.
Remember judges aren't unanimous, the
Supreme Court divides 5-4.
The Senate is often not unanimous.
The House is not unanimous.
If we have non-unanimity elsewhere in our
system.
By the way civil juries don't need to be
unanimous.
Grand juries don't need to be unanimous.
Maybe petit juries, trial juries
in the criminal side don't need to be
unanimous.
Now I could just say the Constitution
doesn't require unanimity, and
you say well Professor, you can't just you
know, hide behind that.
Because you've said there's all sorts of
unwritten things in the Constitution.
And isn't jury unanimity an unwritten
constitutional principle?
And I say well let's think about that.
There are certain unwritten principles
about the jury.
Jury has to for example in my view have 12
people.
Doesn't say so in so many words but that's
what the founders understood a jury to be.
Today's Supreme Court says oh no, it
doesn't have to be 12.
Criminal jury can have six people.
Five's too small but six is okay says the
Supreme Court.
And you should be saying at this point,
huh?
Like where did they come up with that?
Why is five too small and six is okay.
They just made that up.
You could say well, Professor, 12 is made
up.
And I said,
in a sense it's made up but it has a lot
of history.
At the founding, jurors were always 12.
That's basically been true for almost all
of American history in almost all the
states.
So there's a lot of history and tradition
going into that.
When the framers said the, the word jury
they actually meant a system that they
actually had experience with that, that,
they
kind of, the, the, they had inherited and
that
body was in, in the phrase at the time,
twelve good men and true.
Today it has to be good men and women and
true.
But 12 was 12 and that, that's what the
word jury really codified and, as I said,
that
has been our almost unbroken practice by
the overwhelming
majority of states and the federal
government since the founding.
And once you go below 12,
you know, why stop at six.
You know, there's just no principal
stopping point.
Once you go beyond unanimity there
actually are principal stopping points.
Surely there have to be at least a
majority of people willing to convict.
So you need at least 7 of the 12.
And I would say look, if you, if you
look at the Constitution as a whole, think
about impeachment.
Impeachment, two thirds of the Senate,
which in effect it's the jury, has to
convict
and that's just because, and that's not a
capital punishment.
An impeachment, that's just taking away
someone's
office and possibly disqualifying them for
future office.
But if it takes two thirds to do that, it
should take at least two thirds,
more to imprison someone or impose serious
criminal punishment.
So you know what
at least nine of the 12 and that's kind of
a structural idea.
By the way today even though we say,
you know, sometimes jury unanimity is not
quite true.
Suppose the jury in the first case hangs?
Lets say actually it hangs a, you know 6-6
or something.
Well you can have a retrial.
And the retrial yes you're convicted 12-0.
And you say well
that's unanimous.
But only because we're not sort of
counting
those you know, first six who voted for
you.
You know, you say it's 12-0, but it's
really 18-6, you know?
Twelve plus six against get six on the
other side.
So, we in effect today, because of
retrial,
our system, you know, has had
non-unanimous jurors.
And as I said, if you understand that
civil juries don't need to be
unanimous and grand juries don't need to
be
unanimous and the House and the Senate,
you know,
they've never been, you know had a
unanimity requirement
as a general rule and neither have the
judges.
If think we, if we are going to have, open
up jury service to everyone.
And have serious conversations about
whether
punishment is really too savage or not.
People are going to disagree.
On day one,
in order to get people to talk to each
other on
the jury, to have this candid
discussion about conscience among
conscientious citizens.
On day one maybe you need 12-0 to convict,
in order to make sure that everyone gets
listened to.
Henry Fonda has time to make his case.
So maybe day one or the first
two days has to be unanimous and after
that, 11-1 for conviction could suffice.
Maybe after a couple more days 10-2 could
suffice.
9-3 is the bedrock and after a certain
point if the, if there are not
9 votes to convict I think you could just
say well that counts as an acquittal.
In the same way that when
a president is impeached, anything less
than
two thirds, you don't retry the thing.
That counts as an acquittal.
Anything less than two thirds in the
Senate in an impeachment court, that's an
acquittal.
You can do the same thing here.
Um,12-0 on day one.
You know, 10-2 on day three, 9-3 will
suffice on day five, just to give the
early
dissenters a chance to sort to make their
case, make their appeal to conscience for
the others.
And if
at the end of the day at the end of a, a,
week or whatever and you don't get to the
requisite super-majority, that could count
as a case ending acquittal.
Okay.
I'm going to end by talking a little bit,
we've
been talking a lot about jurors and their
conscience.
What about the judicial conscience?
I want to tell you about these two
characters.
I say characters but they're actually
heroes of mine.
Are many heroes
of mine.
Some are, are conservative, some are
liberal.
These were liberal heroes of of mine.
William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall,
they were on the Warren court.
And after a certain point, they basically
refused to
sign off on any death penalty that came
before them.
They basically said, we think the death
penalty we,
we're not going to we're going to vote
against every
capital punishment.
And, although they said, because we think
it's cruel and unusual everywhere, it's
not unusual.
In America that we have capital offenses,
so its
hard to be cruel and unusual if it's not
unusual.
So I think what they were really saying is
not we think
the death penalty is unusual in America,
because it's practiced in America for
certain heinous crimes.
What they were really saying I think is we
think the death penalty is unconscionable.
We as individuals can't sign our names to
these death warrants.
We think we have blood on our hands.
Yes we are going to engage in a certain
kind of pious perjury.
We're going to say the person is guilty.
They should be punished, but not with
death.
Something less than that, because we don't
want blood on our hands.
This was
ultimately an appeal to conscience of a
certain sort.
They said they thought it, they claimed it
was unconstitutional.
I think what they really were saying is
it's unconscionable.
Late in his career on the Supreme
Court Justice Harry Blackman said
something rather similar.
Justice Stevens, shortly before
retirement, came close to this position.
It was more modified version.
But I just basically want to,
and it was a sort of kind of civil
disobedience, maybe.
I am appealing to my fellow citizens
telling
them that, that I'm not going to
participate in
this system which is, which violates my
deep
sense of, of, of fairness and conscience
and morality.
Now it is dangerous when judges just
decide cases according to their own
conscience.
It's very dangerous.
But I just want you to note a few things
about this.
Number one, it had, this appeal to
conscience is asymmetric.
It's not saying I think the person
deserves more
punishment than law allows, you're not
allowed to do that.
Our system is asymmetric, it's tilted in
favor of the criminal defendant.
Less punishment is okay than the law
permits, than the statute requires.
Never more.
Cruel and unusual punishments are
impermissible but
merciful and unusual punishments are not
necessarily impermissible.
So the system is tilted.
It's asymmetric.
It's in favor of the defendant.
His life, his liberties.
So note the asymmetry here.
That they're being
pious.
They are being merciful in this judgement.
They're having pity on the soul of the
person standing in front of them.
Note also, that this is a domain where
judges have cut juries
out of the loop, and maybe juries were
suppose to be more involved.
But because judges have cut them out, and
not telling them about
jury nullification, about acquittals
against the
evidence, maybe the judiciary has a
special
role to fill, this conscience gap that the
judiciary has itself created.
Third note, that this is again, only in a
certain domain.
It's only in the criminal justice system
where
judges are doing things to people standing
in front of them face-to-face.
In a system that they have a lot of
first-hand knowledge of.
They have
an intimate familiarity, judges do, with
the criminal
justice system in a way that ordinary
citizens don't.
I'm not sure that the judicial conscience
is any, you know, better than the
consciences of theologians and
philosophers and morally
serious human beings on all sorts of
issues.
On abortion, on school prayer, on
affirmative action.
I'm not at all sure that the judicial
conscience is any better
than, than the consciences of fellow
citizens.
But in the criminal justice system, it may
very well be that judges actually do know
that system and see its savagery and
unfairness
way more than the rest of us do.
Because we don't daily interact with the
criminal
justice system in a way that judges do.
So they may have more expertise here and
maybe more of a, of a
role to play in telling the rest of us how
it looks to them.
And they, they are more personally
complicit in this because they are signing
death warrants and savage criminal
punishment,
three strikes and you're out, mandatory
minimums.
With their own hands, these, these savage
let's say over punishment of, of
victimless crime in, in drug cases or in,
in three strikes cases.
So may very well be that there is possibly
at least I just want
you to think about this possibly a special
role for conscience in the criminal
justice system.
I'm actually going to end with a a judge
who who, who says the following.
This is actually a judge writing in a law
review article.
What if some state should enact a new law
providing
public lashing or branding the right hand
as a punishment
for certain criminal offenses?
Even if it could be demonstrated
unequivocally, that these
measures were not cruel and unusual
measures in 1791.
And even though no prior Supreme Court
decisions
that specifically disapprove them, I doubt
whether any
federal judges, even among the many who
consider
themselves originalists, would sustain
them against Eighth Amendment challenge.
I confess, says this judge, that in a
crunch
I may prove a fainthearted originalist.
This judge says he's an originalist but in
cases
involving savage punishment he may prove a
fainthearted originalist.
I cannot imagine myself any more than any
other federal
judge upholding a statute that opposes the
punishment of flogging.
So who was that judge?
Was it a liberal squish like Thurgood
Marshall or William Brennan?
The judge
who wrote that was Judge Antonin Scalia,
famous conservative
known for his kind of hard-nosed view of
the law.
But in that he is saying I'm a judge but
I'm also a human being.
I have conscience.
I have a conscience.
It's particularly activated or when in
the criminal justice system where, where
I'm being asked to sign on to certain
savage punishments.
And, and so you hear Justice Scalia sort
of wondering
aloud about what his proper role is as a
human being.
America's written constitution depends on
actual human beings
working the system.
And we want men and women of conscience to
participate in the system as our system
depends on public participation.
Voting on election day.
Being willing to, to serve in, in office,
if summoned by your federal citizen.
your, your, your, your, your, your, your,
your,
fellow cit, citizens to, to serve on a
jury.
To be willing to be a judge and, and
we want men and women of conscience to do
that.
And so the claim is for America's
Constitution to
work and work well we need to think
seriously
about what role we want to recognize for
conscience in our system.
Conscience, I submit, is an important part
of America's unwritten Constitution.
One more chapter to go, stay tuned.
