Welcome back!
We've been talking about various tools and
techniques for going
beyond the written Constitution while
remaining faithful to it.
We've talked about the idea of reading the
Constitution,
not clause by clause, but as a whole and
seeing
larger principles in it, like separation
of powers, checks and
balances, the rule of law, limited
government, federalism, the idea
that no man should be a judge in his own
case.
So that's one technique.
We've talked about the technique of, of
paying
attention to the particular historical
processes by which the
Constitution was in fact enacted and later
amended,
and how those processes gave rise to
certain principles.
Like a broad principle of free speech and
majority rule, at the founding, a broad
principle
of republican governments during the
reconstruction.
We've talked about how careful
constitutional interpreters should pay
attention to the lived experiences of
ordinary Americans, who
in the process of living their lives,
embody all
sorts of unenumerated rights that are
worthy of constitutional protection.
Because the text says that there may
indeed be unwritten, unenumerated rights.
It doesn't quite tell us how to find
them, but says that they shouldn't be
disregarded, disparaged.
and, and one way to, to find them is to
pay attention
to how ordinary people live their lives,
and embody them, a lived constitution.
In the course of examining those tools and
techniques,
we've made passing reference to case law,
to judicial opinions.
But we haven't
focused on judicial opinions front and
center.
And we're going to do that in today's
lecture and the next one.
Because of course case law, judicial
opinions, form one very important
prism through which we read the, the, the
written Constitution.
they, we are going beyond and outside the
written Constitution when we look at the
cases.
The cases,
strictly speaking, aren't the words of the
terse text of the document, this, this
handy-dandy pocket copy.
They, they're outside of it, the,
the, these cases, but, but, in principle
they aim to, to clarify and illuminate it.
And the $64,000 question is, do they
clarify and illuminate,
or do they in fact distort these iconic
and important cases?
We're going to pay particular attention to
the cases of the Warren Court.
You've heard about the Warren Court.
And we're going to talk about it in this
lecture and the next one.
I just, and, by the way, this is Earl
Warren.
He's the person who gives his name to the
Warren Court.
We're going to talk more about him at the
end of the next lecture.
But just to anticipate he's the Chief
Justice of the United States from
1953 to 1969.
His tenure on the, on the court as its
Chief Justice begins with a series of
deliberations and
decision in the landmark segregation case
of Brown vs
Board of Education, which we're going to
talk about.
And it proceeds through the 1950s, and the
1960s with
particularly significant cases extending
the reach of the Bill of Rights,
applying the Bill of Rights against the
states,
and very broadly construing the Bill of
Rights.
And also revolutionizing a judicially
protected right to vote in America.
So these are among the things that the
Warren Court did.
It's customary, to refer to the Supreme
Court
with reference to the name of its chief
justice.
We talked about the Marshall Court, when
John Marshall
was chief justice.
Today, we are living under the Roberts
Court, John Roberts is chief justice.
But by acclamation, I think Earl Warren
Stands up there
in the pantheon along with John Marshall,
very early in the
nation's experience, as, the two of them,
are the, really, the,
the two most notable and significant chief
justices in American history.
And the question we're going to ask is,
did the Warren Court revolution,
because that's what both his friends and
his critics, how they described this era,
did the Warren Court revolution really do
justice to the terse text?
Did it actually, was it faithful to the
text?
Critics said no.
Defenders said sometimes.
Well, sometimes they said no.
But they said, well, who cares about the
text?
I'm going to offer a different account in
which actually the Warren Court
decisions will be measured against the
terse text.
And in fact the Warren Court decisions
hold
up pretty well, not perfectly, but pretty
well.
We're going to focus on 6 areas in
particular that
really I think define the legacy of the
Warren Court.
Today we'll talk about the segregation
decisions of Brown versus Board
of Education and its companion case,
Bowling against Sharpe, which involved
segregation
in D.C. schools.
Not state schools like Topeka, Kansas but,
but federal schools.
So we'll tell you about the segregation
decisions.
We'll talk about the decision by the
Supreme Court to apply the
Bill of Rights, to incorporate it, that's
the phrase, against the states.
'Because the Bill of Rights originally was
designed to protect against the federal
government.
But in the Warren Court virtually all its
provisions came to apply against
state and local governments.
And we'll also talk about freedom of
expression, in particular the landmark
Warren Court decision of, involving the
State of Alabama, a
case called New York Times versus
Sullivan, involving censorship in Alabama
and the Supreme Court's vigorous defense
of a free expression, robust, uninhibited,
wide open free expression.
That's what we're going to talk about
today.
segregation, applying the Bill of Rights
against the states, and free expression.
In our companion lecture, the next
lecture, I'll finish
the story of the Warren Court um; by
talking about,
its landmark decisions involving prayer
and the public schools, the religion
clauses of the Constitution, involving the
so-called exclusionary
rule, allowing criminal defendants to go
free if the
evidence against them was acquired in a
constitutionally improper fashion.
I'm actually going to be very critical of
the exclusionary rule and the more
important expansion
of it in a famous landmark case called
Mapp versus Ohio, extending the
exclusionary rule against states.
And so I'm going to be critical of that
one, then largely supportive of the other
Warren Court decisions.
And we'll also talk
in the next session about the Warren
Court's revolutionary case law
on the right to vote, affirming an idea of
one person,
one vote ending malapportionment, and also
enforcing a very vigorous right
to vote in general against people who were
being denied that right.
So that's the Warren Court legacy.
And at the end, I'll try to put the pieces
together and think about the Warren Court
as a whole.
Let's start with Brown
versus Board of Education, which is really
where Earl Warren starts.
He joins the court in 1953, and the
Brown case was already under consideration
by the Court.
And the Court had decided to hear a new
set of oral arguments.
And then its Chief Justice died and Warren
comes on board.
He's appointed by President Dwight
Eisenhower.
He's a Republican, he had run for the Vice
Presidency of the United States,
actually, alongside Thomas Dewey.
If Dewey had defeated Truman in 1948, Earl
Warren would've been Vice President of the
United States.
Former governor and attorney general of
California, kind of a, a progressive
Republican.
Most of the Court is Democrat appointed
because FDR
has put a lot of people on the Court.
And that's the Court that gives you Brown
versus the Board of Education and the
companion case,
Bolling against Sharpe, in May of 1954,
mid May 1954,
one of the most iconic, momentous moments
in American judicial history.
The segregation cases are announced.
Earl Warren writes for a unanimous court,
saying segregation must end.
Jim Crow is unconstitutional, at least in
education.
This in the sphere of education,
separate is inherently unequal.
The government is not permitted to say,
black kids
over here, white kids over there, in
different schools.
That's what the Brown case said.
States couldn't do that, nor localities
like Topeka,
Kansas, cities, nor could the federal
government do that.
And the question is, where did that come
from?
And my answer is, it comes from the
Constitution.
This is case law faithful
to the Constitution.
The Constitution even at the founding,
said no titles of nobility.
Neither the federal or the state
government can have titles of nobility.
Now what are titles of nobility?
They're, in effect, saying some people are
born
lords, and other people are born serfs, or
commoners.
And there was a clause in the original
Constitution
saying states can't have titles of
nobility, Article 1,
Section, 10, another clause saying the
federal government
can't have titles of nobility, Article 1,
Section 9.
If you take that at face value, I think
the Jim Crow system, a system of massive
apartheid in, in America really did create
kind
of a system of light-skinned lords and
dark-skinned serfs.
Government trying to, to separate, to
create
different classes, castes of, of Americans
based on
whether they were born light-skinned or
dark-skinned,
that kind of hereditary,
intergenerationally entrenched hierarchy.
So even before the Civil War came along,
you could have read the Constitution to
say government
shouldn't be in the business of, of
separating
out and creating castes and hereditary
classes of citizenship.
Now alas, that reading didn't prevail in
the antebellum period.
And basically, it's because slavery
overshadowed everything.
Because the constitution was pro-slavery
as well, in ways that we've talked about.
Now, strictly speaking, you could have
said, oh well, slavery is different.
We're talking here about the status of
free blacks.
And free blacks are different from slaves
and they
should benefit from the anti title of
nobility principle.
But because slavery overhang-, overhung
everything that
reading didn't prevail.
In-, Instead, basically the, the, the
realists, the, the the the non-
idealistic hard headed interpretation of
the Constitution was, actually it doesn't
quite mean what it seems to say on race
because we
all understand that the, the system is
designed to prop up slavery.
And racial hierarchy is part of the slave
system.
Okay, if that's the honest defense of
slavery, I mean of of
of, legal inequality and it's blunt, it's
honest, but if that's the defense,
that world ended with the Civil War and
the Amendments that came afterwards.
The 13th Amendment abolishes slavery
everywhere, immediately, automatically
without compensation.
It says slavery and involuntary servitude
can't exist in America.
And race discrimination is kind of a
relic, a badge of slavery.
But put the Thirteenth Amendment to one
side.
The key amendment, the easy obvious
amendment supporting Brown is the
Fourteenth Amendment.
And the Fourteenth Amendment says two
things.
It says no state shall deny people equal,
any person equal protection of the laws.
And also says it, states, no state shall
abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States.
And one of those privileges might be a
privilege of racial equality.
So, it says no state
can deny equal protection.
And segregation is unequal.
And it says that states can't abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens.
And racial equality is such a privilege.
You might say okay, maybe that's Brown.
But what about Bolling against Sharpe?
That's DC.
Professor, you're saying no state shall
But the first sentence of
the Fourteenth Amendment, even before we
get to the no state shall,
doesn't say anything about states.
It reads much more sweepingly and here's
what it says.
It says, the first sentence of the
Fourteenth Amendment, adopted
after the Civil War, all persons born or
naturalized in the
United States and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof are citizens
of the United States and of the state
wherein they reside.
Everyone born in the United States
is a citizen.
No ifs, ands, or buts.
They're citizens of the United States.
And what it means to be a citizen is to,
and it doesn't say, no state shall.
They are citizens of the United States and
of the state.
This, this is a principle, this
citizenship principle applies against
both sets of government and is a principle
of equal citizenship.
It means we are born equal here in
America.
It's a textualization of the Declaration
of Independence
idea as interpreted by Lincoln in the
Gettysburg Address,
that we're all created equal, we're all
born equal.
Equal birth status.
Some of us, we're not born lords and
serfs.
So, a reaffirmation of that, original
revolutionary idea, that, that,
that basically was compromised when it
came to race and slavery.
But now, it's reaffirming it in the
context of race.
We're all born equally.
We're not born lords and servants.
We're born equally, whether we're born
black or white.
This is very much about the race issue
after the Civil War.
We're born equally, in fact, whether we're
born male or female, or Jew or gentile.
I would say gay or straight, we're born
equal.
That's the idea.
That applies against state governments and
the federal government.
It's an easy and obvious argument for the
results in both Brown and Bolling, because
race segregation
simply wasn't equal.
Counter-arguments.
Oh, but the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment really didn't mean that.
They actually believed in segregation.
And in fact the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment allowed segregation, racial
segregation in the capital galleries.
That's an historical argument of a certain
sort.
Let's take it seriously.
We're going beyond the written
Constitution,
going, history is outside of the text
but let's take seriously what the history
actually shows,
Because I think actually it shows that
Brown is right.
First, a lot of the people who gave you
the Fourteenth amendment though,
though they would call themselves, the
radical Republicans, they were re, racial
integrationists.
They believed actually in full racial
equality.
Now, they weren't all, they weren't the
only folks around.
But they were the, the, heart and soul of
the Republican party.
Let me tell you about two of' them.
Thaddeus Stevens.
Some of you may have seen the movie
Lincoln, and you
know a little bit about Thaddeus Stevens
played by Tommy Lee Jones.
He is the political leader of the
Republicans in the House.
He dies within a month of the Fourteenth
Amendment's adoption, and here's
actually, and he's buried in an integrated
graveyard in In Pennsylvania.
Here's his tombstone.
I repose in this quiet and secluded spot,
not from any natural preference
for solitude but finding other cemetaries
limited as to race by charter rules.
I've chosen this, that I might illustrate
in my
death the principles which I advocated
through a long life.
Equality of man before his creator.
He believes in integration.
He forms, at his death,
an interracial orphanage.
Charles Sumner, an ally of Thaddeus
Stevens.
He's in the Senate, Thaddeus Stevens was
in the House.
He's also in the movie Lincoln and plays
an important role.
A great senator from Massachusetts.
He points out that the floor of the Senate
itself is
actually integrated, that a black senator
from Mississippi is allowed to
sit right alongside whites.
And he says America should look like that.
Here's what he says.
We have had in this chamber a colored
senator from Mississippi.
According to segregationist ideology, we
should have set him apart by himself.
He should not have sat with his brother
Senators.
But see Summer thinks he should have sat
with brother senators, a
vision of fraternity even, and not just
equality and, and liberty, but fraternity.
A colored man is equal
here in this chamber.
I say he should be equal in rights
everywhere.
Now, that's what the leading Republican
crusader said.
Not everyone was on board.
There was segregation, at, when the, when
the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.
But, let's figure out what the arguments
were
for segregation and whether they actually
undercut Brown.
The main argument was, actually
segregation
is equal.
Yes blacks can only be over here, but
whites actually can, have to
be it in their own separate spaces, in
their own railroad cars or schools.
So simple question.
Because in theory what, what they're
saying,
what, in theory separate could be equal.
And if it were equal, it would satisfy the
Constitution.
So, simple question.
Is separate really equal?
Sometimes it can be.
When it comes to, for example, sex
separation.
And we have separate gyms, and separate
gym classes, and public school
sports teams, and locker rooms, and
bathrooms for boys and girls.
And we say well, but this isn't about
propping one gender up, and pushing the
other down.
It's not some, you know, hierarchical
thing.
It's just equal.
The girls prefer it, the boys prefer it.
It's equal.
And it both blacks and whites preferred
segregation, it might be equal.
But that's not what, so separate can be
equal.
But that's just, realistically, that
wasn't what
Jim Crow in the 1950s was about.
It was an imposition by whites on blacks
to create a system of racial hierarchy and
oppression.
So the basic argument
that, that was made in the 1860s, is
separate could be equal, and it might.
Simple question is, was it in 1954?
Answer, no, it wasn't.
Blacks understood that the social meaning
of, of Jim Crow was kind of
apartheid and racial hierarchy system,
saying
whites on top, blacks on the bottom.
Blacks in the back of the bus, whites in
the front of the bus.
A second and related thing that was
sometimes said about
segregation was, oh, the Fourteenth
Amendment doesn't apply to social rights.
But here, and, and, and I think that, that
idea might have several meanings.
One, as long as the races are treated
symmetrically, everything's okay.
No.
If they're treated symmetrically, it might
be okay, it might not be.
We simply have to ask, is it equal?
If it's equal it's okay, if it's not equal
it's not okay.
So, so, so, formal symmetry is not
automatically
unconstitutional, but it's not
automatically constitutional either.
We have to ask ask the equality question.
Second idea that they might says, look
the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the
government action.
It doesn't apply of its own force to
private spheres, to shopping malls, or
restaurants, or theaters.
Fine.
Government might be able to regulate those
domains in the name of equal citizenship.
Congress might be able to pass laws.
But yeah,
the just on, of their own force, the
Fourteenth Amendment is basically aimed
at, at government.
But government is doing the segregating in
Brown
versus Board of Education, before the
Plessey versus Ferguson.
It was government that was saying, blacks
over here, whites over there.
Government they were saying, two people
who wanted to get together, couldn't
socialize if they wanted, if one was
white, and one was black.
They couldn't go to the same school or sit
in the same railroad car.
So, so this was
government action at issue.
And so, so I say, and then
some people say oh, well the Fourteenth
Amendment only applies to states.
It doesn't apply to
so the federal government.
But the first sentence of the Fourteenth
Amendment applies to the federal
government as well.
As do the titles of nobility clauses by
the way.
They apply federal government as well as
the states.
And this was the creation of a racial
hierarchy, a kind of lords and serfs
system.
So I think Brown is not just right but
plainly right.
It's a case, and it does justice to the
written Constitution.
So when we read the written Constitution
through
the prism of these cases, we actually the
text is actually clarified and not
obscured.
Applying the Bill of Rights against the
states.
That's a huge Warren Court project.
The original Bill of Rights actually
applied only against the federal
government.
The First Amendment begins with the words,
Congress
shall make no law of a certain sort.
Ends with the Tenth Amendment that's all
about states' rights.
The Warren Court applied most
of the principles of the Bill of Rights to
the states.
Freedom of speech, and freedom of press,
freedom exercise of religion, all sorts
of criminal procedure, provisions,
counsel, compulsory process,
double jeopardy, jury trial, and so on.
And it did so because of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
And the key words of the Fourteenth
Amendment, let
me repeat them to you, we talked about
this before,
no state shall make or enforce any law
which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States.
Now, what are those privileges,
immunities, fundamental things?
Where do we find evidence that something's
fundamental?
Well, if it's listed in the Bill of
Rights, and the Constitution, that's
evidence that it's fundamental.
So because it's in the First Amendment,
it's, you
know, free speech and, and free exercise
and, and the,
the, the right to assembly, those things
are fundamental.
And and that's the basic textual argument
for
applying the Bill of Rights against the
states.
And that's the argument made by Hugo
Black, who is
also on the court, the Warren Court, with
Earl Warren.
And there is historical evidence to
support that.
The framers
of the Fourteenth Amendment said again and
again that one of their
core purposes was to apply the Bill of
Rights against the states.
The man who actually drafted that language
is a Congressman named John, John Bingham.
This is actually a book I wrote called The
Bill of Rights.
And actually, the endpaper of that book,
Honorable John A Bingham of Ohio, this is
a pamphlet he published in the House of
Representatives, February 28, 1866.
And here's the title of the pamphlet, or
the subtitle, in
support of the proposed Amendment to
enforce the Bill of Rights.
So they said, actually, they were about
applying the Bill of Rights against the
states.
And and that's what the plain meaning of
the words say.
Those are fundamental rights and
privileges.
Counter argument.
Well, professor, why didn't they say Bill
of
Rights then if they meant Bill of Rights?
Because actually, that would have been
more ambiguous.
Because what
does Bill of Rights mean?
First, 8 amendments, first 9, 10.
The Constitution doesn't use that phrase,
Bill of Rights.
So the text, actually, would have been
more ambiguous.
Whereas people, at the time, in the 1860s,
referred to what
we call the Bill of Rights, as privileges
and immunities of citizens.
So, that was actually a more careful
formulation, a more legally precise one.
Oh and also, do they mean, they didn't
just mean only the Bill of Rights.
They wanted more than the Bill of Rights.
Other fundamental rights.
Habeas corpus is not listed in the first 8
Amendments, but
it is a fundamental privilege, a right, a
freedom, an immunity.
Things that aren't listed in the
Constitution but
are fundamental, they wanted states to
basically respect.
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt a right of
a person
to, to present evidence of his innocence,
all sorts of unenumerated
rights that we talked about, they wanted
to protect.
Today that would include privacy.
Privacy sounds a little bit like the word
privilege.
So they wanted more than the Bill of
Rights, and less.
Because the Tenth Amendment arguably is
part of
the Bill of Rights, is the states rights
provision.
But how do you apply a states right
provision against states?
If the Second Amendments is about state
militias being
counterbalanced against a federal army,
that's a state right
of sorts.
Does that right apply against the states?
so, so more than the Bill of Rights, but
maybe arguably less.
Because and, and, maybe it's actually even
a little more
complicated than that, because the, let's
take the Second Amendment.
Maybe it has a states' rights, militia
component, but also an individual right
component, and
the right of a person to have a gun in the
home for self protection.
Well, if it has both of those components,
the individual right sensibly
applies against the states, but maybe not
the states' rights idea.
And the word, if they just said, no state
shall abridge the
Bill of Rights, you, judges wouldn't quite
be able to deal with that.
It would be trying to shove square pegs
into round holes,
because the Second Amendment is both
states' rights and individual rights.
And how do you apply that completely
against the states?
But the language
that they chose is brilliant.
It says, states can't abridge the
privileges and immunities of citizens.
So, we look at the Second Amendment.
We say, well some of it's states' rights,
so that's not really relevant.
But to the extent it's also about an
individual right, a privilege or immunity
of citizens, that right we apply against,
the state, the individual right.
So, so in fact, the framers of the
Fourteenth Amendment
chose very careful language to make clear
their, their core purpose of applying the
Bill of Rights against the states.
and, the Warren Court vindicated, that.
One other argument, professor.
If they meant to apply the Bill of Rights
against the states, and they
did so using the language of privileges
and immunities of citizens, why then did
they
say due process right after that?
Because due process in, is in the Fifth
Amendment.
It's already a privilege or immunity of
citizens.
So, why say it again in a separate due
process law?
And they asked John Bingham, the author
of, of the Fourteenth Amendment
section, when just that question in
Congress, when, when this amendment was
pending.
And he said, listen.
We believe in protecting aliens,
non citizens as well as citizens.
Privileges and immunities protects only
citizens,
but we think aliens have certain rights.
And they have rights to fair courtroom
procedures.
So we have rights of citizens, and we also
have some additional rights of persons
that we are specifying.
Because remember, Bingham says, the Dred
Scott Decision case had said
basically that only citizens have rights,
and we don't believe that.
We think actually people who aren't
citizens have rights.
If Dred Scott had
said only citizens have rights, and blacks
can't be
citizens, we would think that those are
both wrong.
Blacks can be citizens.
That's the first sentence.
Everyone born in America is a citizen,
born an equal citizen.
Black or white, male or female, Jew or
gentile, So Dred Scott's wrong on that.
Blacks can be citizens and indeed are.
Dred Scott said only citizens have rights.
No, we think actually aliens have rights,
too.
So, two big
things we've defended already.
The Brown versus Board of Education
segregation decisions, and the
decisions to apply the Bill of Rights
against the states.
Another important landmark decision of the
Warren Court, a case called New York Times
versus Sullivan, protected a very broad
freedom of speech against
Alabama, which had tried to shut down
opposition newspapers.
Actually, there was a, a protest led by
civil rights marchers in, in the South.
And the New York Times covered the
protest.
And it was an ad run in the
New York Times criticizing Alabama for its
repressive policies.
And Alabama tried to basically, in effect,
shut down the New
York Times and shut down coverage of the
Civil Rights movement.
And the Court said, not so fast, you can't
do that, fundamental free speech.
We've talked about how free speech is a
part of the
Constitution as a whole, even before, you
know, when we read
the Constitution as a document, that it
was part of the
process by which we the people in fact
ordained the Constitution.
That it's part of the lived experience of
ordinary Americans.
How the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment
very much were trying to open up free
speech, because the South had basically
shut down
free speech, the antebellum South in the
1850s.
And now they where trying to do it again
in the 1950s and 60s.
And the court said no.
And doing so affirmed the basic precepts
of the Constitution,
which really that's the core of it, is
free speech.
Critics said, oh, First Amendment, free
speech, that
only means the government can't license
the press.
But once the press publishes stuff, you
can have at them.
Maybe that's what free to press meant at
the founding,
according to Blackstone, but free speech
meant something altogether more broad.
Freedom of speech comes from the idea
freedom
of speech and debate in parliament, free
political discourse.
And in England, only members of
parliament have that, because parliament
is sovereign.
But in America everyone has that, everyone
has the freedom
to express political opinions because we
the people are sovereign.
So in fact, New York Times versus Sullivan
vindicated the deep principles of free
expression in American,
principles that are in the text and the
words free speech, and no state shall
abridge these.
Remember, see how the Fourteenth Amendment
is born from the First.
No law shall make, abridge, those are in
the First Amendment and the Fourteenth.
Now states can't do those.
Just like Congress can't
abridge free speech, neither can states.
So the Warren Court is affirming the text
of the Constitution, the First and
the Fourteenth Amendment, and unwritten
constitutional principles of free
expression that are, that are evident when
we read the document as
a whole, when we pay attention to how it
was actually adopted.
We need to pay attention to the core
purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.
So, so far the Warren Court
is 3 for 3.
Right on segregation, right on
incorporation, applying the Bill
of Rights against the states, and right on
free expression.
In the next lecture we are going to
consider
3 more areas: religion, criminal
procedure, and voting rights.
And there I think his track records will
be 2 out of 3.
And 2 out of 3 ain't bad.
Stay tuned.
