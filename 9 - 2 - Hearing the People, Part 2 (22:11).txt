Welcome back.
Let's go back to Griswold versus
Connecticut for a minute.
I told you about the second justice,
Harlan, and how one of his arguments
for the rightness of the result in
Griswold case that said
that the government couldn't make it a
crime for a married
couple to use contraception in the privacy
of their marital bedroom.
One of the arguments for the rightness of
that,
Justice Harlan said was, was just a simple
counting argument.
Look at all the states.
Only Connecticut had passed this kind of
screwy law and, and this law was
really inconsistent with, with basically
American custom
tradition practice the lived experience of
ordinary Americans.
This is a chapter called America's Lived
Constitution, and, and,
and how do ordinary people live?
They live their lives ordinarily free from
government telling them
if they're married what they can do in the
bedroom.
So that was just a counting kind of
argument.
He also made an argument about the
implicit
Constitution and he said look at the
fourth amendment.
The fourth amendment talks about the right
of
the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects from
unreasonable searches and seizures.
Persons persons, houses, papers and then
everything else, effects.
He says why are they singling out houses?
Above all sorts of other buildings.
Factories, for example.
Schools.
Because they wanted to protect homes and
the life of the home, the privacy of the
home.
We thought the fourth amendment, why are
they talking about persons?
People's bodies?
Because there's a certain privacy that you
have in your body.
He talked about, Harlan duly noted that
the third amendment which is about no
quartering of troops in houses without
some special Congressional authorizations.
So both the the third and the fourth
amendment single out
houses, homes, for special protection.
And Harlan said using, doing kind of an
implicit analysis.
It's not just about protecting the, the
property of the, the, the, the homestead.
It's about protecting the home life within
the homestead.
And he's moving, in this case kind of
away from narrow property conceptions
toward modern privacy law.
and,
and this is one of the bigger moves in
unenumerated rights in Amer, over the
course of American history.
A move away from property as the
organizing idea toward privacy.
So what's up with that?
Because property, that word appears in the
constitution several pras, places.
Privacy, not so much.
But I think one idea is that and, and
earlier cases used substantive due
process, sometimes to protect
the, the, the propertied folk.
In Dred Scott, substantive due process was
used by the court to say
oh, laws can't restrict slave holders
ability
to take their slaves in the territories.
That violates substance of due process
which says that the
government can't mess with life, liberty,
or property without due process.
Now of course the law in Dred Scott had
due process.
The legislature had passed it, it was
being
enforced fairly by judges and juries, but
the
Dred Scott case used this substantive
concept
to say well, we just don't like this
law and that law, of course was not
inconsistent with the lived experience of
ordinary Americans.
Lots of states had free soil laws.
So, so Dred Scott was preposterous, and
it used substantive due process to protect
property.
And in the so called Lochner era the
early, late 19th, early 20th century.
Courts struck down the Supreme Court, in
particular.
Lots of legislation regulating sweatshop
owners, and And
try, and try to protect employee, em,
employees
and, and consumers lots of these laws were
struck down in the name of substantive due
process.
And these laws were basically protecting
property.
Excuse me the, these cases were basically
protecting property.
The Supreme Court was using substantive
due process to protect property in the
Lochner era, in Dredd Scott.
Now, later on, the [INAUDIBLE]
Court, sometimes the same phrase is used,
substantive due process.
But now it is focused on, on liberty more.
And I think let's just jettison the whole
concept of substantive due processes.
Because it it
comes from a phrase of the constitution
that talks about like, liberty and
property altogether.
And if you can protect liberty by striking
down certain kinds of laws well, property
too.
And that could take us back to Lochner and
Dredd Scott.
I prefer talking about privileges and
immunities of citizens.
And even the root word privileges is kind
of more connected to the idea of privacy.
It's not about just processes like
how courts operate, whether the
Legislature let
everyone vote or something like that it's
not just
about process it's, it's about substantive
rights, privileges, privacy.
What is gained when we move from property
to privacy as our organizing metaphor?
I think a certain egalitarianism.
Property is distributed extremely
unequally, necessarily so and some of
those inequalities of property can
actually be then used to undermine
Republican system.
People buying politicians, buying people
with lots of property
the laws that they want and so if we
just protect property in very, very
aggressive ways it
could undermine the basic conditions of,
of a republic.
Now, privacy is a little different.
It's distributed
more equally.
Everyone has one person.
And the rich fellow and the poor person
alike has one person.
You can only be in one bed at one time and
so, in this emerging protection of privacy
and talk about privacy more than property,
we see a kind of egalitarian instinct.
Property excuse me, privacy kind of
marries the best
of, of property and equality, and I think
this is one of the reasons that we see it.
Let's take a case didn't talk about it in
the last lecture but could have, Gideon
versus Wainwright.
In Gideon, the Court says that people have
a right to appointed counsel.
If you can't afford a criminal defense
counselor, if you're charged as a criminal
defendant in a serious case the government
has to provide an attorney for you.
Now I'm not sure that the
founders actually had such a right.
It's not explicit in the constitution and
the founders
in fact did not recognize the right to
paid counsel.
Excuse me appointed counsel in all felony
cases.
In capital cases yes, but not all felony
cases.
But the court recognized this very
famously in Gideon versus Wainwright.
And when they did, at the time that
they did, most states had already begun to
recognize
such a right.
In fact, states wrote an Amicus brief.
22 of the 25 states that weighed in
were actually supporting the defendant in
the case, and
saying we believe that the court should
uphold
a right of criminal defendants to have
appointed council.
So when Gideon came down, it actually fit
the, the emerging, evolving,
lived experiences of Americans, which had
ratcheted up from, from the founding
protection.
But also, so Gideon I think fits with our
lived Constitution ideas.
But it's also more an egalitarian idea.
The framers concept of council was sort of
more property based.
You could have council if you had the
wherewithal, the wealth, the means.
The property to pay for one.
If not, too bad, so sad.
You're out of luck.
But the emerging right of council, the
Gideon right of
council, unenumerated perhaps, but very
strong in our legal culture,
is a more egalitarian version of that.
You get council whether you can pay for it
or not, if you can't the government will
provide it.
And, I think this move from property to
privacy similarly has certain egalitarian
strands to it.
Even the idea of protecting houses among
all forms of, of property.
I think there's at least the idea an
American
myth maybe the reality that, that houses
are fairly widely distributed, that poor
people have houses, middle class people
have houses, not just, not just the
wealthy, that, that that every, and so
when we talk protect houses, we're
sort of protecting a very broad
cross-section of society in an egalitarian
way.
Privacy and, and houses have
egalitarian dimensions.
Think about a whole range of Supreme Court
cases that
protect homes and home life, often
reaching out for different
constitutional, textual basis So, under
the fourth amendment, there are special
rules when the government actually
penetrates the the homestead.
The curtilage,
of the home.
Or whether they, when the gov, the
government shoots some magic ray gun into
your
home to, that can find out when you're
taking a shower or going to the bathroom.
The court has specially protected fourth
amendment
doctrines where the home is invaded or
penetrated.
Special rules about warrants in homes and,
and so that
are needed for home searches but not
necessarily for other searches.
Think about their special rules under the
first, because
that's fourth amendment in the house in
the home.
Under the first amendment you have a
special right to
in the home, to have certain sexually
explicit materials, or erotica.
Today, it would probably be maybe the
internet in, in usage in, in the home.
But a famous case called Stanley versus
Georgia said
even if certain erotic material could be
prohibited.
It can, you, it can't be prohibited if
you're merely using it at home.
There are cases that talk about a right
and
that's kind of connected somehow to the
first amendment.
There are cases kind of free floating
substantive due process
cases that you have a right to home-school
your children.
Maybe those are connected to the free
exercise of
religion because sometimes that home
schooling has a religious
foundation, but a right to raise your kids
and
to home-school your kids, again connected
to home life.
There in recent years, the Supreme Court
has articulated, and I am
supportive of, of this, a right to have a
gun in the home for self-protection.
This is an important part of the American
lived, experienced,
our, our tradition, these rights are
neither left nor right.
They're not just liberal or conservative
and, and so
liberals might like the idea of, of sex in
the home,
and conservatives might like the idea of
guns in the home.
Frankly, both there are deep parts of the
American experience.
They're part of our lived constitution and
constitutional law is, is
not the unique province of a one side of
the spectrum
or the other So we've already now just
seen in that,
in that rundown, the, this idea of private
life, of home
life in a whole bunch of different areas.
Fourth amendment, search and seizure
doctrine, first Amendment
and a doctrine about erotica, and sexually
explicit materials.
On just substantive due process, I
would prefer calling it privileges and
immunities.
Doctrines about home schooling kids also
may be connected to a free exercise.
This a second amendment related right to
have a gun
in the home for self protection.
maybe, one other eh, interesting case
coming out, that's come up recently.
A case a, actually here in my home state
of Connecticut.
It was a woman and she had lived in her
house.
I think maybe for her entire life, and the
government wanted to take that house.
And and, and take it over.
They said they were going to pay her a
fair price, just compensation.
But then they were going to take that
house in
turn and give it to a private developer
who is
going to tear down the whole neighborhood
and build up some,
some more expensive facilities that would
improve the tax base.
That was the theory.
And she said no you can't do that because
you
can't take a home and give it to a private
developer.
And the Supreme Court said, well, taking a
home and
giving it to a private developer isn't
really that different
than taking a home and building a park or
building a fort,
or a school and or a road and since the
government can take
private property for all of those other
purposes it can take it
for this purpose if it really is trying to
raise the tax base.
That is what the Court said.
People focused on this question about
whether
or not giving something to a private
developer
was really public use, because the fifth
amendment says
private property shall not be taken for
public use without
just compensation, so everyone was focused
on, well, is it
really public use to give this to a
private developer?
But I think, forget public use.
Part of what was going on in that case
is this wasn't an ordinary piece of just
property.
It wasn't some investment property by some
absentee landlord.
This was her home and I think we might be
particularly anxious that when
the government was acquiring people's
homes maybe
it's not paying its sufficient just
compensation.
If it's a, an investment property, you
know, you don't care about it.
You just want to make money from it and as
long as they give you a fair
price, you can take that money and plonk
it down and buy some other piece of
property.
And we wouldn't want to give some special
premium to investors
for investment property cause then they'd
have a sense to figure out what
property the government needed, buy it up
one step ahead of the government.
So, so, so as long as we're giving the
private investor market value, maybe we
shouldn't worry so much.
But if you give a home owner new market
value,
maybe you are not really doing justice to
the home owner.
Whether you're going to use that home for
a school, or a park,
or a fort, or a road, or a private
developer, maybe we
have insufficiently robust doctrines about
Just
compensation when it comes to people's
homes.
because there are a lot of people who have
a lot of emotional
attachment to their home, and they
wouldn't sell it for mere market value.
That's the place where they were, were
born, where they've raised their kids,
where
they've lived their lives, where they've
loved
and been loved, and, and and the
recognition
of America's lived constitution would,
would understand, would give effect
maybe to some of those basic facts of, of,
of American life.
And whether we call it fourth amendment
doctrine,
about seizure of the home, or fifth
amendment
doctrine, about just compensation and no
private property
can be taken for public use without just
compensation.
Or they call it unenumerated
rights, whether we call it substantive due
process or privileges in use.
What's more important than the label is a
recognition
that in American culture, homes really are
special, because.
If we're talking about America's live
Constitution,
that's the homes are where Americans live.
And I think this picture which is actually
called
Home Sweet Home is so interesting.
I think just because it captures something
very distinctively American.
This is stylized, of course.
It's a romanticized account of home life,
but I think this
could have, this could be almost any state
in the Union.
It, it, it could of, it could be the
twenty-first
century, it be the twentieth or the
nineteenth, the late eighteenth.
It has, you know, some of these, elements,
of,
of domesticity, and our celebration of
home life, of domestic
life, that have, have long been part of
our American
culture, and they are recognized
in America's unenumerated rights
jurisprudence.
Well we jumped around a lot, we've
talked about all sorts of different
unenumerated rights.
I started with some criminal procedure,
stuff about the rights
to testify on your own behalf, proof
beyond a reasonable doubt
a right to introduce reliable physical
evidence that you're, you're innocent.
I mentioned Gideon and then we talked
about stuff having nothing to
do with criminal procedure, like your
right to be secure in your home.
I want to go back one last time.
To the criminal procedure domain, and tell
you about yet another unenumerated
series of rights where the key idea is
counting, and paying attention to
America's evolving, lived practices.
The eighth amendment says there shouldn't
be cruel and unusual punishments.
And that word unusual actually invites
judges to
pay attention to actual punishment
practices on the ground.
Punishment practices that might evolve.
There was a time when
it was actually quite ordinary and
customary to put people to
death who were juveniles at the time they
committed a murder.
So these are juvenile offenders, they were
17 years
old, 16 years old but they, they committed
murder
and, and there was a time in America when
it was usual to put people like that to
death.
Today that's become unusual, many States
prohibit the death
penalty altogether.
Other states allow the death penalty, but
not for juvenile offenders, not at all.
They have categorical rules, still others
permit in theory, prosecution
of juvenile offenders, but in practice
almost never do it.
And because of that, well pretty recently
in the last a decade and a half the
supreme curt has weighed in and said this
practice of putting juvenile offender's to
death has now became unusual.
It used to be very wide spreed but now its
become unusual because when we count.
And we count all the states that prohibit
the
death penalty, and then the states that
prohibit the
death penalty for juveniles, and the
states that permit
it for juveniles in theory, but don't
really practice it.
When we, when we do a proper counting it
has become
this practice unusual in America to, to
put juvenile offenders to death.
And therefore, unconstitutional.
The court did a similar thing with
criminal defendants of low IQ, of mentally
impaired criminal defendants.
Even if they commit murder, there was a
time when low IQ would not have spared
them from the noose, from a hanging from
the gas chamber or the firing squad.
So there was a time when these punishment
practices were
in fact common and usual.
But now they've become uncommon, unusual
as state after state has moved
away from that practice, either on the
books or in in actual application.
And at the very moment that these
practices became quite unusual, the
Supreme Court weighed in, in a case saying
these are now unconstitutional.
So we see in this a kind of,
of, of dialog.
The court is paying attention to social
practices.
It's a ratchet in that social practices
can give us more rights.
Then the text permits but never less
because
the ninth amendment says there are
unenumerated rights.
Not that there are all sorts of
unenumerated limitations on, on rights.
So basically just to conclude this this
part of this this chapter
America has, has been a place in which
we've been clear from the beginning,
that the constitution lists some of the
right, textualizes.
Some of them are written.
But there are many unwritten rights.
And these unwritten rights should be
protected.
and, in fact, are protected.
My one criticism is that
in protecting them, courts often don't use
the right words in the constitution.
They use words that seem made up to
critics.
Substantive due process.
But instead they should actually point to
the words in
the Constitution that justify this
vigorous protection of unenumerated
rights.
Words in the ninth amendment that talk
about unenumerated rights against the
federal government.
Words in the privileges or immunities
clause
that justify protection, at least
unenumerated rights against states.
No state shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge these privileges
or immunities.
So these are provisions in the
Constitution.
u,, and the word, unusual in the eighth
amendment, that actually justifies what
courts have done.
And courts don't always highlight those,
those words enough.
And so some critics may think that we've
just made all this stuff up.
We haven't.
The written
constitution, itself, contemplates
supplementation and, and,
and careful protection, of these
unenumerated rights.
In the ninth amendment, in the fourteenth
amendment, In the eighth amendment and
elsewhere.
Lots more to cover different still more
tools and
techniques to encounter brave new worlds
to explore,
so stay tuned.
