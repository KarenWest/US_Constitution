Welcome back.
We've come to another critical turning
point
in the story of the American Constitution.
We've pretty much finished a conversation
about the Founding Era.
An era that generates not just the
original Constitution, and and, before it
the
Declaration of Independence, but, that,
that also
includes the first set of constitutional
amendments.
The Bill of Rights amendments.
1 to 10, and the 11th and 12th amendments
that follow shortly thereafter.
The 12th amendment's adopted in the era of
Thomas Jefferson.
It cements his vision of of a more
democratic and, and frankly a more
slavocratic presidential election system.
And with that amendment, the founding era.
The era of
of, of, folks who actually had lived
through the American Revolution.
and, and made and incorporated some of the
ideas of the
American Revolution, some of its themes,
into our, our foundational document.
That era comes to a close.
And the next set of amendments aren't
going to happen for more than a half
century.
So now is
a good time to just to pause and to, to
just recap a bit our 3
themes of democracy, national security,
and slavery.
Let's just trace, just a bit, the
connections
between democracy and national security to
begin with.
Let's remember that there is no
Constitution.
It just doesn't exist unless
Americans are able to successfully, not
merely declare
their independence from Great Britain, but
establish that.
And they need to establish that on a
battle-, on a field of battle.
Through a long and, and bloody war.
And they barely win that war.
They are very lucky to win that war.
George Washington understands that, that
providence smiled
on, on him, again, and again, and again.
It's won only with the help of the French
at critical
moments, and you can't count on the
French, in the future.
And so, Washington understands there's a
geostrategic, a
national security imperative, to create a
stronger central government.
because remember, the Articles of
Confederation just aren't strong
enough to achieve their basic purpose,
which is common defense.
The Declaration says what we're against.
We're against Britain.
And it says what we're for in
terms of principles, we're for unalienable
rights of
life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, no
taxation without representation, jury
trials and so on.
But how is that going to be compete oh
those principles,
how those principles going to be manifest
in a new system of government?
Well state constitutions emerge replacing
colonial governments.
And at the continental level, we have
this Articles of Confederation, which is a
loose
league, an alliance, a treaty, a
confederacy of
sorts, to coordinate military opposition
to King George.
And that alliance has a, had as its
central purpose, basically foreign affairs
and national security, common
defense, and it didn't work well enough
because,
it was premised on the idea that
individual states
would pay into continental coffers, to
support,
the army and the war, individual states
would provide the, the, the
soldiers, and, and the problem is the
individual states really didn't pony up.
They didn't pay when they were supposed
to, they didn't always provide the
manpower
they had promised to, and what do you do
if Virginia doesn't pay up?
You can't put Virginia in jail, so, the
Constitution emerges as a national
security alternative to
the article of confederation, and, and and
a
foreign affairs alternative to the
Articles of Confederation.
In foreign affairs, the Articles of
Confederation promise that
America's that this continental assembly
would, would make
treaties with foreign nations.
But the problem is, individual states
sometimes violated those treaties, and
then gave
the foreign nations an excuse to not keep
their end of the bargain.
So Britain, at the end of the
Revolutionary
War, promised to abandon a whole bunch of
forts.
And it, it, it refused to, to honor it,
using as
its excuse, well, different states,
haven't followed the treaty of peace.
So since individual states were violating
the treaty of peace, Britain didn't
have to keep up its end which was to
evacuate the forts.
Now, as an alternative, to that Articles
of
Federation regime, we have a Constitution
that emerges.
And the Constitution is going to give this
new central government power to not just
make
treaties, but to make those enforceable
law, [UNKNOWN]
that the states are going to have to
follow.
It's going to have power
to impose taxes on individuals, and if an
individual
doesn't pay, you can put him or her in
jail.
And with that tax money, it has the power
to create it's own army and pay
for it, and to regulate western territory
again
something the Articles of Confederation,
sort of, hadn't provided for.
So now we're going to have a much more
powerful central government with the power
to tax people, and raise armies, and
conduct foreign affairs, and negotiate
treaties that will
really be binding law and regulate the
west and regulate interstate commerce and
international commerce.
And it's a lot more dangerous, because it
really can pass laws now that bind
individuals.
So, we have to have some safeguards.
It has to be more representative.
Because individuals are going to be taxed,
they have to be represented.
Because it's actually a real legislature
that can pass real laws.
It should
be broken into two, just like state
legislatures in most of the state's wares.
It's gotta be bicameral.
We're going to need a separate executive
brand to check and balance it, so it
doesn't get out of control the way
some state legislatures have gotten out of
control.
And that separate executive is also
going to have
be of, of value in national security,
because
he's going to be able to, to lead, be
a commander-in-chief, and
negotiator-in-chief,
and, and diplomat-in-chief, and
have some weightiness, some gravitas on,
on
the on the international stage, and that's
going to be especially true when George
Washington
becomes president, as everyone expects him
to be.
You need a separate judiciary, both to
enforce these, treaties and
continental laws against recalcitrant
states, and
also to check and balance Congress.
So precisely because you're craving a more
powerful legislature,
you need to break it into two to create a
separate executive, to create a separate
judiciary, both of which
are also going to be useful for
geostrategic purposes, to ensure,
to negotiate good treaties, and ensure
their compliance by states.
So, the national security of paradigm now
explains a lot of the existing
constitution now.
Who, whose the big loser in this game
with a lot more power in the federal
government?
The states, are the big losers.
The state governments, they probably are
not going to be as excited about this new
constitution, and so in order to get the
constitution launched, the framers
at Philadelphia do an end run around state
governments and say, we're going to
actually propose our plan to the people
themselves, rather than to ordinary state
governments.
We'll get them to sign on.
And by the way, we, we're going to do away
with unanimity,
because if unanimity is required, Rhode
Island will veto the whole project.
So, as an end-around state governments,
the constitution appeals
to the people themselves, driven by this
national security imperative.
The Philidelphia insiders actually have to
play an outsiders game.
Appealing to the people themselves, going
over the heads of state governments.
State governments had legitimacy, they had
traced back to the colonial
governments that had been up and running
for in
Virginia, Virginia's case 150 years before
the American Revolution.
But state governments actually might not
go for this system that drains
so much power for them, so the framers
appealed to the people themselves.
And if people themselves are going to be
asked to ratify it, you're
going to have to put in this document a
lot of democratic sweeteners.
Regular elections and no property
qualifications
for office holders and and all sorts of
egalitarian ideas
that are going to get the people to vote
for the thing.
You're going to have to let the centers
speak up,
because otherwise, there's not going to be
a democratic buy-in.
So starting from a simple premise, of
national security, I
think we've traced many of the features of
the Constitution.
Separation of powers,
bicameralism, strong executives and, and
judiciaries
the very idea of popular ratification,
which in turn is going to require all
sorts of other democratic sweeteners.
And of course, leads to, that ratification
process, a bill of rights.
Cause the first thing that people say,
when they're
asked about the constitution is, what
about the rights?
Precisely cause we're creating a much more
powerful central
government, we want the bill of rights
limiting it,
just as bills of rights limit state
governments, because this
new government is a lot more powerful than
the articles confederation.
Maybe you didn't edit bill of rights in
the articles confederation,
but you do need one against this new
government and, and
and when that bill of rights is passed, it
begins with
a promise that congress won't abridge free
speech and free press.
Within a decade,
congress does abridge free speech and free
press by
passing a law in the middle of a quasi-war
with France, a naval war, in which John
Adams
signs his name to the Alien and Sedition
Act.
And the Sedition Act makes it a crime, to
criticize the federal government.
It's a crime to criticize John Adams, or,
and to criticize congressional incumbents.
It's actually not a crime, interestingly
enough,
to criticize the vice president, Thomas
Jefferson,
who's the leader of the other party.
It's a crime for challengers to criticize
incumbents, but not for incumbents to
criticize challengers.
And Jefferson and his party thinks that
all this, stinks.
And he mobilizes his folks in the election
of 1800, and beats John Adams in the
rematch.
And when he comes
into power, his party, constitutionalizes,
their interest in
a 12th amendment that as we saw, is
pro-democratic in certain ways, it, it
makes for
a more democratic, popularly
accountable Plebiscitarian party-based,
partisan presidency.
So, in that way it actually is encouraging
American
democracy, which is being channeled
through the party system,
but it's also more pro-slavery, because it
entrenches the, the
3 5ths clause compromise, that's built in
to the electoral college.
So, we started from a simple premise of
national security, and
we've deduced a lot of the Constitution
from that simple premise.
and, and, and we could bring the founding
era to a close, with the 12th amendment.
And we see in play the themes of
democracy,
and, and national security.
And this theme of slavery actually, also
especially with the 12th amendment.
Now, that system, the founder system, will
eventually fail.
We call that failure the Civil War, and
part of the reason it
fails is, I'd, would say probably
the biggest reason, it didn't eradicate
slavery.
It didn't put slavery on the path
of ultimate extinction.
It, for example, gave Congress, this
constitution, the power to eliminate
slavery in
the territories, but it didn't require
Congress to eliminate slavery in the
territories.
And Congress actually chose to eliminate
slavery from some territories, but not
others, and we were lucky, just
lucky, that eventually those free
territories predominated.
Imagine, a world in which most of the
early
immigration flows into the southwest
rather than the northwest.
Well, in that kind of world, if the south
wins the early footrace for Western
settlers, maybe it actually is able to
expand slavery throughout the territories.
That didn't happen because northern
Indians got defeated.
First and so lots of people flowed into
Ohio.
It didn't
happen because lots of European immigrants
wanted
to come to the northwest where there was
free labor, rather than the southwest
where
they would have to compete against slave
labor.
And, and some of 'em were simply racist.
They didn't want to live alongside lots
of, of, of black people.
It didn't happen because there was less
early slave importation.
That might have been anticipated, because
there was a, a slave revolt
in Haiti led by Toussaint L'ouverture.
And once that Haitian slave revolt had
occurred, some southern jurisdictions were
scared of importing
too many slaves from the Caribbean,
because
those slaves might have actually been,
part, been
participants in slave revolts, or might
have
seen black people killing white people
and, and
those are kind of dangerous viruses that
you'd be importing into into your own
state
if you, if you imported those slaves.
So, there were fewer slaves that got
imported into the
south, and the southwest then had, been
anticipated, more early immigration
poured into the northwest than, might have
been predicted, and as
a result, kind of luckily, the north won
the foot race,
for western land.
The Constitution could have done better.
It could have said, no slavery in the
territories,
or no slavery in any of the territories
after 1808,
and it didn't do that, and we got lucky,
in a way, that the north predominated over
the south.
now, the structure of the Constitution,
remember, through the
three-fifths clause, tilts the presidency
in favor of the south.
And that becomes entrenched after the 12th
Amendment.
Thomas Jefferson's ascension.
And Jefferson is going to be succeeded by
Andrew
Jackson, eventually, who, who was the,
carries the
banner of the party that Jefferson and
Madison,
both slave-holding Virginians, they found
a party that
they call themselves the Republicans, but
they eventually are renamed the Democrats.
And that becomes Andrew Jackson's party,
and Jackson is Democratic and national
security-oriented.
He's a general can beat the British.
And pro-slavery, and he puts on the court,
proslavery
jurists like Roger Taney, who succeeds
John Marshall, who in the Dred Scott
case, says actually Congress can't
prohibit slavery in the territories.
Now that's preposterous, Congress had
tried to prohibit slavery
in certain territories from 1789 on, the
northwest ordinance.
And the constitution, It didn't require
that Congress prohibit slavery in the
territories,
but it surely permitted Congress to
prohibit slavery in any territory it
chose.
But by 1857, the Supreme Court
is saying otherwise.
And, and when the Supreme Court says
otherwise and when slavery starts to
spread even into the northwest, when
Jackson's party has become and the
party of Franklin Pierce and James
Buchanan, and even places north of a
certain line are allowed to have slavery
in Kansas, in bleeding Kansas.
When that happens, when the Democrat party
starts
to aggressively push a pro-slavery agenda,
a man
named Lincoln, who had left politics,
pretty much,
comes back in, gets sucked in, in the
1850s.
And eventually will lead an anti-slavery
party, a very different kind of
Republican party, to victory in 1860, 61.
His election
is in some ways ironic.
He wins in the electoral college.
He gets less than 40% of the, of the
popular vote nationwide.
But he basically sweeps the north, except
for New Jersey and maybe one
or two other places.
But pretty much fills an inside straights.
Wins, basically, in all the the, the
northern states.
And, and is elected president through the
electoral college.
Even though that electoral college had
been
designed at Philadelphia and redesigned in
the
12th Amendment, in some ways, to
accommodate
and even favor slavery through the
three-fifths clause.
And what is his platform?
Is he pro, he is the
first openly anti-slavery President in
American history.
Until then, all your Presidents have
basically been either Southerners, or
Northern men of Southern sympathies,
that's the phrase.
People like James Buchanan from
Pennsylvania, Franklin
Pierce from New Hampshire, who Democrats,
Jackson's party.
And even though they're from nor, the
North, north
of the Mason-Dixon line, they basically
danced the slaveocrats too.
And they basically are appealing to the
base of their party.
And the base of their party, which is the
dominant political party
in Antebellum, America.
The base of that party is a southern base.
So all your presidents before Lincoln are
basically southerners or
northern men of southern sympathies, and
Lincoln is openly anti-slavery.
The first openly anti-slavery president in
American history.
And what's his anti-slavery agenda?
Is that he's going to get rid of slavery
in the southern states, now, not at all.
He's not an immediate abolitionist.
indeed, he's, he says I'm not sure that
the federal government has power
to get rid of slavery, where it it exists
in, in the states.
That's a states' rights issue.
His agenda is much more modest than that.
Read my lips, "No New Slavery" is
basically his motto.
In other words, let's try to exclude
slavery from the territories.
And let's get more, in the territories,
if we exclude slavery, which Dred Scott
says you see you can't do.
Dred Scott has proclaimed
Lincoln's party's platform basically
unconstitutional.
Dred Scott has said, preposterously, in
1857,
that slavery must be allowed into the
territories.
Lincoln's part Republican party says no,
no slavery in the territories.
And we will thereby put slavery, this is
Lincoln's phrase, on a path of ultimate
extinction.
Eventually, these free territories will
join the
union on, on equal footing as free states.
And eventually now, the free states will
outnumber the slave states.
And eventually, slavery instead of
expanding, will begin to contract.
And I think the hope is, eventually states
on the border, will gradually
eliminate slavery, as many Northern states
had already done, and maybe
the Federal government could give some
sweeteners to the remaining states saying
if
you get rid of slavery, we'll compensate
you for the, the financial dislocation.
So that's Lincoln's plan, it's a, it's a
100 year plan,
he, he announces in the 1850's is, if you
adopt my plan,
I think we can get rid of slavery, In 100
years or more,
and so he, it's, it's not an immediate
emancipation, immediate abolition
in this plan at all, and Lincoln's being
realistic because in the places where
slavery has
been abolished, in some of the northern
states,
places like Pennsylvania, places like New
York, New Jersey.
The abolition of slavery had been a
gradual affair.
And even in Connecticut, where they didn't
have very many slaves, it took generations
to
basically get rid of the small amount of
slave holding that exists.
And even in New Jersey, it took
generations.
The basic idea of emancipation state by
state was, let's end in the northern
states.
Let's end slavery as a system, without
freeing individual slaves.
And here's how we can do it.
We can say, after July 4th of next year,
with the
legislature will pass law, after July 4th
of next year, everyone who is born to a
slave mother, will be an indentured
servant for
25 years, the first 25 years, and free
thereafter.
Everyone who is now a slave, will die a
slave.
And everyone who's born after July 4th
will, in effect, be
indentured, enslaved, for the first 25
years, but free after that.
And then,
basically, with the passage of time, the
slaves die, the the indentured servants
reach maturity.
They eventually are free.
Their children are free.
Eventually, slavery ends.
But existing slave masters basically get
$0.95
on the dollar or something like that.
They basically get the benefit of their
investment for a very long time.
The future is given
to freedom, but the present is conceded to
slavery.
That's the Lincolnian compromise, slavery
is wrong, but we can't get rid of it
immediately, cause so much of our economy
and society are based on it, so
let's put it on a path of ultimate
extinction, and the way we do
that is first by eliminating slavery, by
saying no new slavery in the territories.
That's
Lincoln's vision, it's very gradual, it's
not anything like what eventually happens.
What eventually happens is we're going to
get rid of
slavery everywhere, immediately, without
compensation, you know, within 5
years of Lincoln's election, and in the
next lecture,
I'll tell you how that happened, so stay
tuned.
