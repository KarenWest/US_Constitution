[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
We've not reached our final chapter, quite
literally in the story of the written
Constitution.
I say quite literally, because as you'll
recall we're
walking through the written constitution
in textual order and in
the process we're also tracking a book
that I
did in nine, in 2005 called America's
Constitution, a biography.
And that book tracks the flow of the text,
which is in turn chronologically laid out.
We started with the founding era.
The original constitution followed very
quickly, by the
first ten amendments, the so called Bill
of Rights.
A judiciary limiting 11th Amendment and a
pro populist, pro partisan presidency,
pro democracy but alas, also pro slavery
12th Amendment
codifying kind of the Jeffersonian vision
of the presidency.
And that brought the founding era to a
close.
The original Constitution and the first 12
amendments.
Then we flash, we move forward in time.
And after the Civil War, we encountered
the 13th, 14th,
and 15th amendments, ending Slavery and
guaranteeing
civil and eventually political equality,
to African Americans.
More recently we, we flashed forward yet
again
and focused on the amendments of the
progressive era.
The beginning of the 20th century, we
focus particular attention on the 16th,
17th, and
19th amendments from that era, income tax,
direct election of senators, and, and
woman suffrage.
Today and in the next lecture we're
going to talk about the more modern
amendments, the late 20th-century
amendments.
And as I said that's the last chapter
of, of the book America's Constitution, a
biography.
But before we talk about them, the late
20th century amendments, you
might have thought that I gave short
shrift to the 18th and the 21st amendments
from the, the early 20th century.
The 18th enacting prohibition, and
the 21st, repealing it.
If you thought that, you were right.
I did kind of breeze by those, because
the 21st basically, in effect, undoes the
18th.
I can't cover everything in exquisite
detail, in these lectures.
If you do want more background on, on
those amendments or
on virtually anything else that we
discussed in, in this online course.
The book has lots more detail
on that.
But I thought I should say a word or
two about, the 18th and the 21st before
moving forward.
The 18th Amendment was part of the
progressive
era and those who supported prohibition
saw it as.
Consistent with many of those who support
it so I
was very consistent, with the other
reforms of the era.
An era that gave
us initiative and referendum and recall.
The pol, political primaries, a kind of
democratic reform.
Direct election of senators.
This is an era resist, that was which a
lot of social energy was spent sort of
resisting forces of corruption, corporate
corruption, city bosses.
City legislatures were seen some what
corrupt in the way they
picked Senators.
Often taking bribes from the likes of
direct election of senators.
Was kind of a clean government reform.
It turns out that, in order to run clean
elections, that requires a lot of money
too, campaign contributions.
But maybe that money is spread around in
ad campaigns, directed at
the populace rather than slipped into the
pockets of of state legislators.
But direct election of senators was a kind
of reform.
And, and, and, and women's suffrage of
course
Prohibition was also seen as a reform of
sorts.
The saloons in big cities were seen as
particularly.
Corrupt places there's a feminist angle to
the whole thing.
Many women felt that men, especially
working men were
getting their wages on Friday afternoon,
going into the saloon,
drinking down their wages rather than
bringing, the the money home.
To their wives and, and kids instead,
because they had been drinking too much
at the saloon, they would come, home and
beat up their wives and kids.
That was a stereotype or an image that,
that, that fueled
the prohibition movement, and it was a
movement strongly supported by women.
Remember maybe from the history books a
famous organization you
might have heard of, the Women Christian
Temperance Movement.
And indeed one of the major forces that
lobbied against women's suffrage was the
liquor lobby.
Because they feared that woman's suffrage
would
actually lead to prohibition, leads to dry
laws.
And indeed the 18th Amendment and the 19th
Amendment are coming from the same error.
Prohibition also had a, a national
security angle.
There was
a need for grain during World War I.
And, and, and people said, well, grain is
being
diverted to, to make beer and, and other
things.
So
I did want to just briefly mention
prohibition since I
gave it short-shrift last time It's the
one amendment
really of all of them, that arguably
restricts liberty
and equality, and interestingly it's the
one that doesn't take.
Shortly after prohibition is passed in the
19 teens
it's repealed in the early 1930s, so, And
that's
the 21st Amendment.
And that's one of the reasons I didn't
spend so much time on it.
Because the 21st that cancels out the
18th.
But one interesting question is how is it
from a process point of view.
That an amendment could be passed.
Remember it requires 2 3rds the House, 2
3rds the Senate, 3 quarters the States.
And, yet, so quickly they're out there.
You get 2 3rds, 2 3rds, 3 quarters, for
the exact opposite position.
How could that switching happen so soon?
And and one factor, I think is, that,
that, this was an era, the early
20th century, of, of democratic
experimentation, that progressors
believed in, in progress, we've been
trying things.
But also learning from the data, and
many people considered prohibition a
failed experiment.
It was designed to stamp out the
corruption, of the saloon it
didn't do that at all.
It drove liquor underground.
Speakeasies, and a lot of organized crime
by the time of the the Great
Depression a lot of people wanted and
perhaps needed a drink from time to time.
And if you repeal Prohibition you, and
brought this industry back into the
daylight,
you could tax it.
And that would be a source of,
of government revenue, a sorely needed
revenue
So some people who supported prohibition
in
the 19-teens, some politicians actually
changed their minds.
So you can look at the votes, and you can
see some people who voted both for
prohibition and it's repeal.
But another factor is that prohibition
emerged from a somewhat mal-apportioned
system.
Cities tended to be wet, pro-liquor,
counties
tended to be dry, anti liquor
prohibitionist.
And in the early 20th century, lots of
state
legislatures, were malapportioned, and
many house districts were malapportioned.
And, so, in this mal-apportionment the
counties, counted for
the rural counties counted for more than
their fair share.
The cities got short-shrift.
They weren't really proportionately
represented,
the urban areas, which were wet.
More immigrant more,
a pro liquor and, and so the, the process
that generated the 18th Amendment
was one that kind of over weighted rural
areas in the ratification process.
And even in the House of Representatives.
By the time of the 21st Amendment however,
Congress
for the first and only time said, we want
this
amendment to be ratified.
Not by state legislators.
But by specially elected conventions of
the citizens.
And those specially elected conventions,
were in effect
in many places, adopted, one person one
vote statewide.
So there wasn't the amount of
malapportionment.
So cities played a bigger, role in that
process.
So with both direct election of senators,
and the 21st Amendment we see an
anticipation
of the one person, one vote idea.
Remember, when Senators are picked by
state legislators and state legislators
are
malapportioned, and the senate is
basically
a feature of that, that malproportion
system.
But with the 17th Amendment, direct
election Senators.
You count all the, the voters in the state
equally, one person, one vote.
And, and so the senate itself is a one
person one vote idea.
And so to the process,
that generated the 21st Amendment involved
one person one vote.
It's also possible that ordinary people
are more
willing to just sort of vote openly for
liquor,
where some politicians, state legisla so,
so in
the convention, I'm basically they're not
ordinary politicians, there.
It's kind of like a referandum of sorts.
And people vote their preferences, they,
they want to drink.
But politicians, the state
legislatures, even though they may
occasionally
have a drink or two themselves
on the sly, they, they might have
hesitated to vote for liquor.
To be seen as soft on, on morality or
something like that.
So, there is sometimes a possibility that
ordinary voters might
have a sort of, different tendencies than
the professional politicians.
Okay, so that was the 18th and the 21st,
and now let's
carry the story forward in time.
Recall that virtually all the amendments,
that we've had have
come in generational spurts or clusters
and the founding era the
first 12 beginning as shortly after the
constitution is ratified
and ending, with, in Thomas Jefferson's
first administration the 12th Amendment.
12 amendments ten in the bill of rights,
11 in
the judiciary, and 12th modifying the
rules
of the electoral college that's, the
founding
generation's amendments, and then you have
the
Civil War Reconstruction generation's
amendments, 13, 14, 15.
Then you have this spurt of amendments in
the 19 teens
carrying forward to the repeal of, of
prohibition in the early 1930s.
and, the final set of amendments were all
ratified
in generational, a later generational
spurt, pretty much.
The next spurt is really going to be the
1960s.
But there's one stand-alone amendment,
kind of, that's worth mentioning.
Then the the final amendment is a little a
tricky so
I'll, I'll tell you about that tomorrow in
the next lecture.
But, but, the two term amendment, the
22nd Amendment kind of stands alone
chronologically.
It's ratified in 1951, so it's you know,
almost 20 years after the lame duck
amendment and the repeal of prohibition,
which was
early on in Franklin Roosevelt's ad, ad,
administration.
And so, so 20 years basically after the
last set of amendments and ten years
before the next cluster, this two term
amendment kind of just stands out there on
its own chronologically.
And let's, let's talk about that
amendment.
Remember that the original constitution on
on paper allows for a President to be
perpetually re-elected, every four years,
he has to come before the electorate.
And four years means, absolutely four
years Come
hell or high water we hold presidential
elections.
In the middle of civil wars and
world wars, and great depressions.
That's not true in an English
Parliamentary
system, where the elections can sometimes
be
pushed back and in fact, in, in
world war II, basically Parliament
postponed elections.
There basically was no election at all, a
regular parliamentary election, be,
in England, between 1935 and 1945.
But in America, we held elections
on schedule every four years for the
presidency.
Lincoln in the middle of the Civil War
submits to the voters judgement.
And lets see, under the founders
writ, written constitution, presidents are
perpetually re-eligible.
But, as we talked about before, George
Washington set all sorts of important
precedents.
And one of the most important is that he
stepped down after two terms.
He would have been reelected had he stood
for a third term.
He was unanimously picked the first time
around in 1789, he was unanimously
re-elected.
In 1792, he would have been unanimously,
or virtually unanimously, re-re-elected,
but he stepped down.
And he didn't say a lot about it,um, but
later Americans came to understand
that Washington was sending a signal that
the republic needs to be bigger
than any one person, and he was kind of
imp arched sending this message that other
people are perfectly capable of carrying
the, the torch.
And indeed Thomas Jefferson wins
re-election.
He steps down after, after his second term
and says explicitly,
I don't think we should have in effect a
lifetime presidency.
John Adams,
of course, runs for re-election and loses,
so it's not really an issue for him.
But when Thomas Jefferson wins his second
term, at
the end of that he declines to run again.
And remember in the states.
Governors that were
governorships that had no term limits to
them, the governors were almost
always re-elected basically until they
died or you know, were
close to death.
John Hancock in Massachusetts, George
Clinton, in New York Trumbull in, in, in
Connecticut, also in New Jersey.
Governors who could run for re-election
ran again and again and again and
were almost always elected.
But Jefferson didn't like that model, so
he said, like Washington, I think I
should step down after two terms After
Jefferson, James Madison did the same
thing.
James Munroe did the same thing, John
Quincy Adams runs
for re-election and loses to Andrew
Jackson after two terms.
Steps down, thus a tradition emerges, it's
not in
the text, but it's a tradition of two
terms.
Now, that tradition isn't inviable, the
next
president who gets re-elected, Abraham
Lincoln, is assassinated.
So we, we never know whether he would have
chosen to follow that example or not.
McKinley also is assassinated in his
second term, so, we don't know.
We do know that there were some
presidents, who,
did dream at least of, of, of third terms.
It's a little cheeky though, given the
tradition, if you're
basically saying, well I'm greater than
General Jackson and General
Washington and Thomas Jefferson and James
Madison, because, you know,
I'm going to seek a third term even though
they didn't.
But, Ulysses Grant, after two terms
steps down, following the Washington
precedent, and
Grant is a lot of ways like
George Washington, this general above
political party.
He steps down, but then,
four years later, he gets the itch and he
kind of runs again.
And maybe, you see, the tradition is not
so clear, is it
no, is it that no third term, or no third
consecutive term.
There's an ambiguity in this unwritten
tradition, so Grant steps down and
[UNKNOWN] runs in the Republican process
that Republican convention
four years later doesn't get it.
Grover Cleveland, he wins and he loses his
bid for re-election, then he runs again
and wins.
So he now has two terms, and he dreams of
a third term,
it wouldn't be a third consecutive term,
it would be a third total term.
But only a second consecutive term.
But the Democratic party isn't interested
in having him.
There's another issue unresolved in the
tradition, how do you count partial terms?
Teddy Roosevelt basically has three years
as president when
McKinley dies, then he wins in his own
right.
Can he run for a second term in his own
right?
Two full terms as president plus an early
threes,
well he decides not to but then four years
later
he, and, and Taft becomes president, but
four years later
Ro, Teddy Roosevelt gets the itch again,
and he runs.
And he says, yeah, when I said that I, I
didn't want a third term, I meant a third
consecutive term.
If I said I didn't want a third cup of
coffee, coffee,
no one would think that I was forever
giving up the beverage.
so, he runs, loses Woodrow Wilson is
dreaming
of a third term even after his stroke.
So, so the tradition is ambiguous in
certain respects, how to think about third
terms,
how to think about non consecutive terms
and
of course famously Franklin Roosevelt
serves not two,
not three, but he actually serves into his
fourth term.
He dies early in his fourth term.
But he, he runs for a third term and gets
the re-elected
for that third term, runs for a fourth
term and gets re-elected.
And in the wake of that, the two term
amendment the 22nd Amendment
emerges, and it's kind of a retrospective
rebuke to some extent of,
of the Roosevelt precedent.
It's saying, you know, never again should
one person make himself so indispensable.
And remember this is a merging in a world
where
there's anxiety about other mili, other
strong leaders around the world.
Stalin, and Hitler and Mussolini and
people say, American
democracy should never be organized around
one indispensable man.
The fearless leader, the big brother, so
the critique
is that we shouldn't have, basically
presidencies for life.
The folks other there say, it's up to the
voters to decide,
we have elections and if you don't want
the fellow vote against him.
And the believer in, in presidential term
limits say, no, but a president, as a
practical matter, can entrench himself in
all
sorts ways and make himself an
indispensable leader.
And so in the name of democracy we're
going to limit presidential terms.
And interestingly, once the federal
government does that,
a bunch of states follow suit for
governorships.
Many states though prohibit just more than
two consecutive terms, but they allow non
consecutive third and even, fourth terms.
But once
again we see a very interesting interplay
between
state govern, state constitutions and the
federal constitution.
State the Constitution was modelled on
state constitutions, to some extent.
It created, and in turn was copied by,
state constitutions, the
Constitution, in particular the
presidency,
created a very strong executive branch.
And then states started to
reconfigure at the founding their
governorships to
look more like presidents, four year
terms.
Veto pen, pardon pens became much more
common at the
state editorial level after article two
had put forth that model.
And so too after the constitution the
federal constitution is amended to add
term limits for the presidency, bunch of
state constitutions add term limits for
governorship.
Now these term limits create very
interesting incentives and I'm going to
close actually with a, this lecture, with
a conversation about what, what happens
when you term limit the executive.
Well one thing maybe you see in, in
is, is that that you, that we've seen
is actually President's in their second
term are weakened.
They're lame ducks from day, in, from day
one and so their enemies can come
out and attack them knowing that they're
not
going to even be able to threaten to run.
On the third term and vanquished their
foes, and so we've seen in second
term presidencies recently Richard Nixon
resigning
in disgrace under the threat of
impeachment.
Bill Clinton actually being impeached, not
convicted
but impeached, Ronald Regan having Iran
being wounded politically.
And Iran contra in his second term George
W Bush
kind of limping along a bit in his second
term.
We'll see how the Obama second term runs,
but one
feature structurally is that the two-term
amendment makes a
President a lame-duck at the beginning of
the second term.
At the state level sometimes term-limited
governors
have, have pec, run their lives, in
effective.
You know vote for Lerleen Wallace, for
George
Wallace's additional term and you know Maw
Ferguson
in Texas so, so.
And that's been the strategy that
sometimes has occurred at the state level.
But final thing I want to talk about is
federal level, is how this
weakening of the presidency to the two
term amendment has actually empowered the
vice-presidents.
If a president can't run for a third term
on
his own, but he can run in fact by proxy
by taking his wing man, his Vice President
will be his third term.
And before the two term amendment you
didn't see, Vice Presidents weren't very
significant.
They were significant the founding
because, the founding at the very,
very beginning was the guy who comes in
second for the presidency.
So John Adams was someone substantial, and
so was Thomas Jefferson,
they ran for the presidency came you know
but came in second.
But remember the 12th Amendment let's you
vote
separately for president and
vice-president, creates a ticket
system and after the 12th Amendment
vice-presidents basically
are, are, really not typically very
important political figures.
There are one or two who are significant
but generally not, but after
the 22nd Amendment, vice pres, presidents
kind of begin to come into their own.
Bet, between the 12th Amendment and
the 22nd Amendment, the two term
amendment, only about 15% percent of vice
presidents ever ran, won the party
their party nomination for the presidency
itself.
They weren't sort of major figures, but
since the two term amendment, more than
half
of them have a vice presidents have
actually
won the party nomination for presidency
later on.
At the end of the 20th Century, I think
five resigning
presidents all, sort of, watched their
wingman,
their vice president, sort of, run for
president.
In his own right, so, Eisenhower watched
Nixon run and
Nix, and, and Johnson watched Humphrey run
for president, his, his, vice president.
And Richard Nixon, who had just, who had
resigned, already watched, Gerald Ford
run and Regan watched George H.W. Bush run
and Clinton watched, Gore run.
And win again the party nomination, so,
one of the important stories of the 22nd
Amendment has been how it's actually
strengthened the
political tag team between president and
vice president.
Vice presidents become presidents wingman,
and,
and the way, in effect in the modern era
you win a third term you become like
Franklin
Roosevelt, as not by running and winning
in your
own right, but having your own hand picked
successor run.
George, H.W. Bush, that was Reagan's third
term, on this interpretation.
Now two of the themes that we've talked
about today, one
person one vote, and the tag team between
president and vice
president are going to be themes we're
also going to
see in the last round of amendments from
the 1960s.
And that's going to be the story I'm
going to tell you in the next lecture.
So, hope to see you.
