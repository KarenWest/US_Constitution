[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
We're now beginning of the second half of
our course on
America's constitution, having focused on
the
written constitution in the first half.
We're going to be focusing on America's
unwritten
constitution in the second half of the
course.
And, and maybe for some of you them's
fighting words.
What do you mean unwritten constitution,
professor?
I thought that you were always waving
around that copy of the written
constitution and telling us that these
8,000 words anchor the entire
constitutional project.
And that's right.
That's what I did say, that's I do
believe.
That's my story I'm sticking to it.
These words and the written constitution
do anchor the constitutional project, but
we're going to need to go beneath, beyond,
and behind them in
order to fully be faithful to them, to do
justice to these words.
These words, for example, don't contain a
set of instructions about
how the constitution is to be interpreted,
a complete set of instructions.
And you might say, well, Professor, they
don't, but
the English language does and just read
the words.
The words, all the words, and nothing but
the words, you might think.
Okay.
But the words don't say the Bill of
Rights.
And yet, maybe it's useful to talk about
the first ten amendments as a package.
The words don't say separation of powers.
And yet, that might be a very useful way
of
thinking about the architecture of the
document as a whole.
Articles one, two, and three, separate
articles vesting separate powers,
legislative, executive, and judicial,
respectively, and separate branches.
But you won't see that phrase, separation
of powers.
You will see it in some state
constitutions, but it's not
in the U.S. constitution, nor is the
phrase, checks and balances.
Or the phrase, limited government.
The rule of law, federalism.
Now, all of these things, I submit,
are obvious essential parts of our
constitutional experience.
But you won't find them in so many words
in this terse text.
Now you might say, okay.
There obviously is a, a, is a need to,
to sort of imply certain concepts, like
separation of powers,
checks and balances, limited government
and I would say fine
but where does it say we get to imply
stuff?
That's, itself, an unwritten idea.
And you might say, well.
but, but these things sort of supplement,
the written constitution.
But we could never take anything away from
the written constitution.
And I would say, fair enough.
But when you look at the written
constitution itself.
Sometimes its words read narrowly
and literalistically are a little
problematically.
They may not actually make sense in light
of the constitutional project as a whole.
A simple question I'm going to come back
to it at the end of, of this lecture.
Simple question.
Who presides, at the vice president's
impeachment trial.
because if you read the words of the
constitution, literally
and narrowly, the words say that senate
tries all impeachment.
It's the court of impeachment, and the
vice president presides over the senate.
And there are a couple of exceptions that
are mentioned.
But there's not an explicit exception when
the vice president himself is the
impeachment defendant.
Is, is, is hi, being his charge with
having committed a high crime in this
community.
So the text doesn't explicitly make an
exception.
When the Vice President is himself an
impeachment offense.
If you just read the words, the whole
words, nothing but the words, it might
seem
as if the Vice President presides at his
own impeachment trial, but can that be
right?
Is that what the constitution.
Really says rightly understood, when we
understand the proper rules of legal
interpretation, which I'm going to argue
have to go beyond narrow literalism?
Take the first amendment, it says, freedom
of speech and freedom of press, but it
says, Congress shall make no law abridging
freedom of speech and of the press.
Well what happens if the President.
Starts messing with freedom of speech with
a censorship edict.
Or Federal courts try to shut down freedom
of speech in the press on their own
motion.
What if states try to suppress free
speech?
If it's just about the words of the first
amendment.
The words and nothing but the words of the
first amendment.
Was the first congress free to suppress
free speech
and abridge free speech and free press,
because remember
the first congress and the first few
months under
the constitution, the first amendment
hadn't been adopted yet.
So before the first amendment came along,
was congress free to do these things?
And after the first amendment.
What about presidential censorship or
judicial censorship or state censorship?
So, if it's just the words the words say
someone
can't be put twice in jeopardy, well what
about three times?
The words say, you can't be put in, in
jeopardy of life or limb.
But what happens if they're not going to
try you a second time and, and hang you,
take away your life or dismember you, take
away a limb, but just put you in jail?
For the rest of your life.
Hard labor.
because the words say life for them, so,
oh and by the way, the
words also say in the ninth amendment say
that there might be unenumerated rights.
Unlisted rights.
Rights that aren't textually specified,
but the ninth amendment,
so to take that seriously, those words
seriously, I suggest.
We're going to need in, in effect to go
beyond, textual literalism but the ninth
amendment doesn't tell us, explicitly in
so many words how we have to, find these
unenumerated rights which it suggests
might be
out there So I'm going to argue that
actually we have more rights than the text
explicit lists and new rates, never less.
As a [UNKNOWN] matter.
And, and we are being faithful to the
ninth amendment
when we add rights to the constitution in
various ways.
But.
There are rules for that game.
It's not, not all it, it's not that all
bets are off.
That the judges, or other interpreters,
can just make
stuff up and just call it the ninth
amendment.
So, the constitution's text, I'm going to
argue, itself, invites supplementation in
various ways.
It presupposes in all sorts of ways an
unwritten constitution that completes it,
that makes sense of.
Of the, the, the larger constitutional
project.
So, so here's the challenge.
The ninth amendment seems to suggest we
need to go beyond the written
constitution.
I've given you some other reasons for
thinking so.
The language of the first amendment.
The absence of concepts like separation
of,
of explicitly, separation of powers,
checks and balances.
The rule of law, I could have said.
Doesn't say one person one vote.
Doesn't say separate is inherently
unequal.
So where did we get these bedrock
principles from?
because it's not necessarily from the
words simply radicalisitically,
and yet many of these things i'm going to
argue are
not merely uncontroversial today, accepted
on judges on both
sides of the isle by republicans as well
as democrats.
In the political branches.
It's, it's not just that, that they are
widely
accepted, but that they are correctly and
properly accepted.
That in effect today we are all
textualists and
we are all living constitutionalists of a
certain sort.
There really are ground rules for this
project.
And the second half of the course is going
to be to try the.
Show you what those ground rules are.
They're ground rules of interpretation.
There are a variety tech, a variety of
techniques, not an infinite number, but a
variety
of techniques and tools of interpretation
through which
we can go beneath, beyond, behind the
written words.
While still remaining ultimately faithful
to a written constitution.
It's deepest premises while basically so
there are going to be ways
of supplanting, the text without ever it
should be supplementing the text.
Without ever supplanting it.
so, we.
There are going to be ways of finding this
unwritten, and, and, and
deploying this unwritten constitution in a
way that ultimately vindicates the written
constitution.
And that's the challenge.
because not everything that, that is
beyond the written
constitution is in fact faithful to the
written constitution.
So, so.
The way we're going to organize this half
of the, of
the course is quite different than what
we've done so far.
What we've done so far is walk-through the
written constitution.
Article by article.
Amendment by amendment and now
we're going to actually organize things
differently.
The biggest part of America's unwritten
constitution
is basically the rules for interpreting
the constitution.
because remember, the constitution doesn't
tell us in ex, in
exclusive and, and exhaustive detail, how
it is to be construed.
How it is to be implemented.
There are various tools and techniques for
doing
that for, for implementing and construing
the constitution.
Textualism is one of those tools and
techniques,
and we've already done a fair amount of
textualism and we will continue to do
that,
but there are other tools and techniques,
and.
Each chapter of the book, America's
Unwritten Constitution, the
book that's going to anchor this second
half of the course.
Each chapter, of this second book,
um,introduces you the reader, you the
audience, to a different tool or technique
of constitutional interpretation.
It goes beyond a literalism, but is never
the less, properly lawful.
Faithful to the constitutional project is
something, in fact, that judges and
lawyers of all stripes, from all parts of
the political spectrum do, in fact, do.
Whether they admit it or not all the time,
they actually do do it.
They accept these tools and techniques.
They are the proper kit bag of the
constitutional interpreter, even though.
These tools and techniques are not
themselves explicitly mentioned in the
document.
So that's what we're going to do for the
second half is identify these tools and
techniques
and I'll give you examples, applications
of how
these tools and techniques are, are
properly applied.
And also sometimes give you examples of
what would do too far with what you can't.
properly, just read into the constitution
or supplement.
because you can't just make stuff up, and
call it the constitution.
There are going to be rules to this game.
now, let's take, for example, freedom of
speech, since I mentioned the first
amendment.
We can find that in the first amendment.
But if we just focus on the words, it just
says congress, doesn't say anything
about the president or federal courts, or
states, those words materialized in 1791
when the
Bill of Rights is ratified, the first
amendment is ratified, but I'm going to
claim that
even 1789, and even in 1790, before those
words were adopted, there was a deeper.
Free speech principle that was even
broader than the
words of the first amendment, and I'm
going to show
you actually that this idea of free speech
can
be found in several components of our
unwritten constitution.
One chapter, the first chapter I'm going
to
teach you a technique about reading
between the lines.
Reading the constitution as a whole and
appreciating its
structure, its architecture, the
constitution's about a system of
popular self-government, and that system
presupposes that ordinary people,
we the people, can engage in a, a robust.
Uninhibited, wide-open freedom of
political expression.
Government works for us.
They are our agents, our servants.
We are the masters.
We are sovereign.
And therefore, in order to, to be
sovereign, we
get to talk amongst ourselves and, and
trade political ideas.
And they can't shut us down, not Congress,
not Federal Courts.
Not presidents, not states.
And that's true even before the first
amendment's adopted.
Because the basic constitutional project
[UNKNOWN] when you read the document
as a whole is about free and fair
elections and popular sovereignty.
And those things make no sense, unless the
people have robust, uninhibited, wide-open
freedom of political expression.
It's a structural argument.
That's one way of deducing free speech,
now in a later
chapter I'm going to say, look here's
another argument for free speech.
Forget about the text for a moment.
Lets look at actually how the constitution
in fact
came about and it's more of a historical
argument.
How it was in fact, indeed.
Ordained and established and it was
established, with an epic
exercise of freedom of speech even before
the first amendment came
along there was the freedom of speech that
was baked
into the constitutional cake because of
the year that changed everything.
The hinge.
Of human history.
That year 1787, 88 where we the people did
ordain and establish the constitution.
Well we did that through free speech.
Free speech was part of the very process
by which the Constitution becomes law.
It's part of our Constitution.
Not just when we look at the
words holistically, the architecture, the
whole thing,
but when we look historically how the
constitution was in fact ordained and
established.
This is a different kind of tool and
technique than holistic reading.
It's a little bit more historical.
How in fact, was the constitution adopted?
Enacted if you will, how was it amended
and what principles and were big and
necessary important components of that
enactment and amendment
process and therefore baked into the
constitutional cake.
Now here's yet another way of thinking of
the unwritten constitution.
Let's think about the ninth amendment for
a minute.
It talks about unenumerated rights.
It talks about rights of the people.
Well, how do the people actually manifest
they, their
understanding of, their belief in cert,
unenumerated right to.
Well, one of the ways we the people
manifest our, our understanding
of rights is just by living them out to
day to day.
How ordinary people live their lives.
And they live their lives with freedom of
speech.
It, it's part of the, the custom of
America, the tradition.
That's the kind of a Burkian argument.
the, the English philosopher and
parliamentary leader, Edmund Burke.
Talked about basically the, the, the folk
ways and the customs of a people.
And the ninth amendment tells us that not
all rights are enumerated.
One source of those rights is going to be
custom, tradition.
Free speech is a very important part of
the
America's, America's lived experience on
the ground day to day.
We do all sorts of things.
We live our lives freely.
In part through free speech and free
press.
well, here's yet another technique.
We have to, re, read the Constitution
not just unaided just by examining the
document.
We sometimes read the constitution through
the prism of case law.
The constitution itself talks about the
judicial power in article three, and
supreme
court cases in particular play a
particularly important role in our
constitutional project.
And I'm going to offers some ways of
thinking
about the relationship between case law,
between precedent.
And this terse text, the document itself.
But when we look at case law we see again
and
again emphatic affirmations of freedom of
the speech and of the press.
In iconic cases like New York Times versus
Sullivan that today.
Every justice on the Supreme Court, left,
right and center pledges allegiance to.
So, I've given you already a few different
I've foreshadowed a few
chapters of the book, different techniques
and tools and shown you how
free speech is going to be an application
in in various, a, a,
an application that we can see using
various of these tools and techniques.
Reading the constitution as a whole
Chapter One.
Seeing how the document was in fact
enacted an amendment over, over time.
Chapter two paying attention to the
lived customs and practices of ordinary
Americans.
How, how we just live our ordinary lives.
Free speech is a part of that.
Chapter three, paying attention to case
law,
to precedent, which is an important
component.
Of the American constitutional project,
chapters four and five.
And free speech is going to pop up yet
again in
later chapter so this part of the course
is organized
around to repeat the tools and techniques
of constitutional interpretation
that go beyond textualism but ultimately
try to, to fit with.
Careful attention to the written
constitution properly understood.
Now a, as, is a tradition in, in this
course I have an image up on
the screen and I just want to zoom in by
telling you a little it about this image.
This image is the image of this, the
companion book.
To the one that we've just summarized,
the, the
first book that we covered was, America's
Constitution, A Biography.
The sequel, is called America's Unwritten
Constitution.
It's not required, at all, but if you want
to get more, depth
of understanding, because there's only so
much we can do in this online experience.
I recommend the book.
It's available at, at bookstores and
online and in libraries.
I think the hardback runs about $20.
And I hope it'll be out in paperback soon
maybe even for, for something like $15.
It tells you basically what it's about,
America's unwritten Constitution.
But here's something I want you.
To notice.
If you actually just read it using the
standard rules of English, from left to
right.
Actually, here's how it reads.
America's the precedence, unwritten and
principles constitution we live by.
Which is totally garbled, 'kay?
Here's how we just read it.
We read the title which is in one
font, America's Unwritten Constitution,
and then in effect
we see the subtitle if we read more
carefully, the precedents and principles
we live by.
And that's because, the different fonts
here
are actually signalling to you the reader
that
there, there's more meaning here, there,
there's
sort of levels of coded meaning just
beyond.
The straight forward read left to right,
top to bottom.
And in fact
the, the subtitle in particular I want you
to notice, is
in fact between the lines, the precedence
and principles we live by.
So this is a reminder, that there are all
sorts of levels of, of meaning, of proper
meaning.
That can't necessarily be deduced, merely
from the most narrow and literalistic
analysis.
But they are never the less there, are
supposed to be there.
You would read it the wrong way if you
just read it.
This top to bottom, left to right.
You would read America's the Precedence
Unwritten and Principles Constitution We
Live By.
But once you understand that one of the
many tools
and techniques is to re, read between the
lines, you
will see, that this book is America's
Unwritten Constitution, in
effect colon, even though the colon is
written at all.
America's Unwritten Constitution, colon,
The Precedence and Principles We Live By.
And in fact, our first chapter is
going to be about that particular, the
interesting technique.
It's a technique of reading and therefore
of textualism about reading between the
lines.
Not just reading word by word and clause
by clause, but more holistically.
That's what we're going to do in the next
couple of lectures.
Here's what I'd like you to do, to get
ready for that one.
Ask yourself a simple question, who
presides at the vice presidents
impeachment trial?
