Welcome back we're in the middle of our
discusion of
the war in court and the war in court
revolution.
We've talked about three prominent.
Areas of case law that that revolution
involved.
Its segregation, the segregation decisions
in 1954, Brown versus
Board of Education and it's companion
case, Bolling versus Sharpe.
We talked about a series of cases
in which the Warren Court came to apply,
to incorporate, that's
the phrase, the Bill of Rights against
state and local governments.
And we talked about a landmark free
expression case, New York Times versus
Sullivan.
In which the court upheld the right of
Americans to engage in robust,
uninhibited and wide-open freedom of
speech including sharp
attacks on government officials So, today
we're going
to talk about three other areas of Warren
court case law and pull the camera back
and talk about the Warren court as a
whole.
So, another famous and controversial
series of cases in the Warren
court involved, prayer in the public
schools and, and the court, basically.
Eliminated organized, state runs, school
sponsored and
directed prayer in the public schools in a
series of cases in the early 1960s.
Engel and Abington are two of the
important cases here.
And.
So, where does the constitution say that,
professor?
Well, the constitution does in the first
amendment talk about free exercise
of religion and the idea that there should
be a federal establishment of religion.
Now recall that, of course, thanks to
incorporation,
these basic principles, in so far as
they're principles
of liberty, and equality and freedom as
opposed to
mere state's rights, these basic
principles apply against states
as well as the federal government.
They're incorporated.
Now think about organized prayer in the
public schools and ask yourself.
Is that really consistent with full
religious
liberty and equality which are the
fundamental principals.
So when the government is writing the
prayer, well whose prayer is it going to
write?
Is it going to right a Christian prayer?
Well, not everyone is Christian.
Is that
really equal?
Even if it writes a Christian prayer.
Is it going to write the protestant prayer
or Catholic prayer?
If we're going to do Bible reading, are we
going to read from
the King James Bible or the, the Catholic,
the Douay Bible?
How's the Apocrypha going to be treated?
Which translation are we going to use?
So now government, when it makes all these
decisions, is picking sides.
It's choosing one.
Religion and often within that one sect,
one prayer
to, to privelage to advantage over the
others, and at
the very least if government tries to do
that,
students of different faiths have a right
to not participate.
They have a right to be excused, obviously
they can't
be, no one can be compelled in America
really to.
To engage in a religious worship ceremony
contrary to their own faith tenets.
so, so at the very minimum you would have
to actually excuse folks of
other religions, but here's what would
happen
when you do that in the public schools.
You have to in fact be segregating
students at that moment of prayer.
On the basis of basically their religious
beliefs.
Some people would have to stand up and
stand out from the others.
And this was a court remember, a
very sensitive to the social meaning of
segregation.
Of, of, of the government dividing kids a
particularly.
So, so remember this was a court that
earlier
in the Warren court era, has, era, has
given you.
Brown versus Board of Education, and,
Bowling versus Sharp.
So, I think the same kind of sensitivity
to the ways in which, segregation could
itself be,
unequal, calling attention, to certain
distinctions, among
people, some are born lighter-skinned than
others.
Some have different faiths than others,
and,
the basic thought is government shouldn't
be in
that business, that is a violation of
the deep idea of religious liberty and
equality.
Seems to me that's a very
plausible Understanding, of our
constitutional precepts.
Perhaps not, compelled, there might be
other interpretations but here I think
as elsewhere the, the case law
actually buttresses, supports, clarifies,
the constitutional text.
It's a useful lens, or prism, through
which we can engage the text.
Now, I'm going to have a, I have
a different view about the so-called
exclusionary rule.
Under this rule that the Warren Court,
that predated
the Warren Court that first appeared in
Supreme Court
case like the beginning of the 20th
century, when the federal
government was involved, but that the
Warren Court extended to states.
In a early 1960s case called Map versus
Ohio.
This principle, basically is as follows.
If the government, state, or federal,
according to the Warren
Court, it's extending it to the principle
of the states.
If the government acquires certain
evidence against a suspect.
And that evidence is acquired in violation
of the fourth
amendment, then that evidence can't be
used in, a judicial,
in that criminal case against that defend,
even if the
evidence is completely, one hundred
percent reliable, it's the smoking gun.
And it's got the um,defendants
fingerprints all over it.
It's the bloody knife with the victims
blood with her blood
on the blade and, and his um,um, uh,uh,
bloody fingerprints on the handle even
it's completely reliable evidence of guilt
under
the exclusionary rule um,it can be tossed.
From the, the case.
And the guilty defendant may walk free,
grinning.
Much to the shagrin and, and the horror of
the victim and or her family.
I'm, I'm using gender here because often
criminal victims are women.
Often, perpetrators are, are men.
And the question is, where does the
constitution say that?
And my answer is, it doesn't.
It doesn't in any of the ways actually and
it doesn't in any of the ways
the proper ways, of going beyond and
beneath
and behind the constitution while
remaining faithful to it.
So the fourth amendment's texts doesn't
say any about exclusion of evidence.
And no framer of the Constitution said
anything
supportive of, of something like the
exclusionary rule.
The universal rule at the founding, in
federal courts and
in every state court, and most states you
see have 4th
amendment Counterparts in their state
constitution was reliable evidence comes
in and English, that has always been the
rule of England.
Ahm, in fact, here's a sentence from an
English judge.
It matters not how you get it if you steal
it even it would be admissible.
The question is, is it reliable?
So no founder the text doesn't say
exclusion.
No founder thought so.
For the first 100 years in America, no
court, state, or federal.
First 100 years after the declaration
of Independence, no exclusion anywhere in
America.
As I said, that's never been the British
rule.
And you say okay well professor fine, so
it's not in the text,
but you yourself believe in going beyond
the text in all sorts of ways.
Yes I do.
So, is a right of exclusion implicit when
we read between the lines?
Is it a is it.
I say when we read between the lines,
here's the
principle, we protect innocent people
against the possibility of erroneous
conviction.
So, yeah, the text doesn't say
a right to have an appointed lawyer.
And actually that wasn't the uniform early
practice, but
without a lawyer you might be innocent and
nevertheless convicted.
And we don't believe in that.
That's not, the system is designed to sort
the innocent from the guilty.
And in order to do that in today's world,
everyone needs a lawyer.
And if you can't pay for it, we pay for
it.
The government pays for it.
because that's central to innocence
protection.
Yes, the text doesn't say you have a right
to, to introduce reliable
physical evidence of your innocence, but
that
innocence protective So we should do that.
Yes the text doesn't say proof beyond a
reasonable doubt, but that will
protect a possibly innocent person from
being
erroneously convicted, that's the deep
constitutional provision.
So, when we read between the lines
it's about protecting innocents not guilt
as such.
And the exclusionary rule protects the
guilty as such.
Well, we talked about another principle.
The lived constitutional principle
about looking at how counting practices
and, and learning from bottom up customs.
And, and understandings of, of the
citizenry.
When Gideon versus Wainwright was decided
by the Warren court.
45 of the fifty states already gave
criminal defendants paid attorney's.
So it was already in all felony cases, and
other states actually
of the five gave them in some sub set of
cases.
So, when the Winship case was decided,
almost everywhere you had proof beyond
reasonable doubt.
When the court affirmed that a defendant
had a right, criminal defendant, take the
stand, and his, his, his own behalf,
almost all the states had already done
that.
Those things were part of the lived
constitution.
Not so with the exclusionary rule.
When the court extended
the exclusionary rule to the states, the
Warren court Actually most states
where most Americans lived did not have
comparable exclusionary rule principles.
And where states had exclusionary rule
principles, these had
basically been concocted by judges often
without strong popular support.
And so as actually we're going to see.
Interestingly this one area, the
exclusionary rule, is
not only the area where the Warren court
was most strayed furthest from the, the,
the,
the proper, a proper understanding of the
unwritten Constitution.
It's also been the one area where later
courts have pushed back the hardest.
So this is the one thing, the exclusionary
rule where the Warren court legacy
actually has
been weakest.
And the other areas as we are going to see
later courts
have actually endorsed the Warren court
vision and the other five areas.
When it comes to, to segregation and
incorporation of the bill of rights
against the
states, and broad protection of free
expression
and religious liberty and equality, and
voting rights.
Which the other area, so now let me talk
about voting rights for,
for just a minute.
The Supreme Court affirmed a broad right
of, of, of, of people to vote
and to have their vote counted equally One
person, one vote.
An end to malapportioned state legislative
systems where let's say a
hamlet of a thousand people sent one
representative to the state capital and
the state legislature, and right next door
a
city of 20,000 people also sent one
representative.
So massively unequal.
Full apportionment, before the Warren
court, and
the Warren court ended that saying, nope.
Representatives represent people not the
trees or acres,
that's a direct quote from chief justice
Warren
in the famous case called Reynolds versus
Simms,
and the basic idea, the take home of
that is one person, one vote.
The districts have to be pretty much equal
size for congressional seats within a
state, for state legislative seats.
Both the lower house and the upper house
of the state legislature.
So the state senate can't be
malapportioned.
Can't treat counties.
Give each, give counties.
Equal weight if they were of, of different
populations
the way the Senate, the US Senate does
give states
actually equal weight even if there are
very different populations.
California is a lot more than Wyoming.
In the US Senate Wyoming and California
count equally.
But that, you can't do that at the county
level in any state senate.
Randalls versus Sims.
Says basically that in elections for the
state assembly, the state senate and also
in another Warren court case, for
congressional delegates,
the districts have to be pretty much
equal-sized.
And where does that come from, you say?
The court said the equal protection
clause, but now
you know enough to know that that's a
little tricky.
Because equal protection was about aliens
who weren't even citizens, it's
sort of an odd way to talk about the right
to vote.
The framers of the 14th Amendment didn't
think that Section
one was really about a right to vote.
That's why you needed the 15th Amendment.
14th Amendment was about race
discrimination, but not in voting.
Elsewhere, civil rights, not political
rights, not about voting, that's why
you needed the 15 Amendment, which was
about race discrimination in voting.
That's why you needed the 19th Amendment,
which
was about race, about sex discrimination
in voting.
If equal protection did all the work, and
said,
no discrimination in voting, boy the 15
and the 19
Amendment weren't even necessary.
So, so what the Warren court said.
Equal protection didn't quite make sense.
But it did, these cases did make sense to
the Constitution as a whole.
The Constitution, five times after the
Civil War, talks about our rights to vote.
And in Section two of the 14th Amendment,
it says if there are deprivations of the
right to vote, There should be, there has
to be a penalty paid, the states should
get fewer representatives in the House of
Representatives, the Electoral College.
And since they've never paid that penalty,
at all, actually I think the text
says if they don't pay a penalty then
everyone has to vote and vote equally.
And if, and if they're not voted equally,
or if they're not voting, a penalty
must be paid, they should get fewer seats
in the House and the Electoral College.
But since they're not getting fewer seats.
No discrimination in voting.
Everyone has to vote and
all the, you know, and, and the votes have
to be counted equally.
And by everyone, the 14th Amendment,
Section 2, said, male citizens
who are resident and and adults, and
non-felons.
Amendment, male doesn't mean male any
more.
It means male or female, because the 19th
Amendment's
about women suffrage and the 14th
Amendment actually says 21.
That was the age
but after the 26th Amendment, that's now
18 but
the basic presumptive base is adult
citizen, residents, get
to vote and the 14th Amendment, section
two actually
says that then, and actually these Warren
court cases.
Really do affirm that.
And think about what would happen if
you didn't have some principle of people
voting.
Would it
be okay for, example, a legislature to
come up with apportionment rules?
So, the 51, let's imagine a legislature of
100 seats, so the
51 senior members of the legislature, they
each have their own little district.
They vote for themselves and now they've
got a lot, they've got a majority.
And the entire rest of the state is
divided up among the rest of us.
Well that can't be right.
That's, that's not a Republican form of
government, the government
from the people.
And and so if that can't be right, then
there'd have
to be some limits on the ability of states
to malapportion.
And the Warren court announces the limit.
And one easy enforcement rule is just
count the
votes equally and, you know what I just
did?
I slipped in another constitutional
clause.
Did you, did you notice it?
I mentioned the Republican Government
Clause of Article 4.
Yes,
at the founding, that clause wasn't very
vigorously
enforced because slave holders wouldn't
have wanted the
Federal government to monitor too closely
how they
counted slaves or didn't in state
legislative apportionments or.
How they treated free blacks, or didn't
let them vote.
So before the Civil War, I can understand
that the Republican government cause
had a very narrow reading possibly,
because
the antebellum south wouldn't have wanted
robust
federal enforcement of this idea of
republican government.
But we saw in earlier lectures, that
during the
Civil War itself, and especially right
after The word.
And the very process by which
the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
were adopted.
Congress embraced a very broad reading of
the Republican government clause.
Now, states are going to have to be held
to very high Democratic standards.
That.
Understanding that new understanding of
the Republican government clause
was baked into the constitutional cake, so
to speak.
It was part of their process that gave us
the Reconstruction Amendments
and I think the war courts picking up on
all of that.
It says well, Congress read the The
republican government clause very
broadly in the 1860's, but there's nothing
in that clause that only
congress can enforce it.
So it's permissible for federal courts to
protect voting rights very vigorously in
the 1960's.
Building on that same fundamental precept
that after the Civil War.
There's an important federal role in
making sure that states
meet very high standards of, of, of
democracy in republican government.
The court called
that equal protection.
I would've preferred, because equal
protection is about
persons (aliens, not citizens) and voting
is all about
citizens, really, I would've preferred
that they had
called it the Republican Government Clause
or Section 2.
Of the 14th Amendment that does say the
right to vote shall not be
abridged, and unequal counting of votes is
an abridgement, of sorts okay, let's sum
up.
So I think that,
in the voting area the Warren Court pretty
much got it right, as
it did in segregation, and incorporation,
and
free expression, and religious liberty,
but not.
In on the exclusionary rule.
Let's just take a step back.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit
about this picture.
This is Earl Warren and as I said it's
conventional
to refer to Supreme Courts by focusing on
their Chief Justice.
He wasn't the only person obviously.
He in the Warren Court, alongside him was
a great.
senator, former senate, he was a
Republican governor from California.
And along him, there was a former
Democratic senator from Alabama,
Hugo Black, and a former New Jersey
Democrat judge.
William Brandon.
So, a northerner, a southerner, a
westerner.
A northern Democrat, a southern Democrat a
western Republican.
A governor, a senator, a judge.
And this triumvirate, Brandon, Black.
And Warren, together really lead the
Warren court.
and, and and, and the world was
transformed.
Let me just remind you what the world
looked like before Earl Warren took over.
Massive racial segregation.
American apartheid ruled
a huge portions of, of, of America.
Jim Crow reigned
supreme.
Many states disfranchised blacks
with impunity and had,
had been characterized by massive
malapportionment.
Without and in many cases the
malapportionment was very much racially
based, white
rural areas were over represented at the
expense of black urban areas, black,
cities.
The Bill of Rights didn't generally apply
against the states.
Many states have gotten away with.
Suppressing free speech and,
and, and the court hadn't always reliably
and consistently
stood up for free speech even involving
core political expressions.
State-organized prayer was commonplace in
the public.
Schools criminal defendants had precious
few constitutional rights the judges
protected.
That's the world of 1953, and it's not our
world, that's an
unrecognizable world.
In the course of 16 years, Earl Warren and
company revolutionized Our constitutional
understandings.
So there is no Jim Crow today.
There is no massive malapportionment and
deprivations on,
on, on the kind of scale that existed in
1953 on the right to vote Today
there is no organised school prayer.
This is sort of wide spread and everywhere
today.
The Bill of Rights generally does apply
against the states.
Fraud protection of free speech are really
the law of the land.
Robust uninhibited and wide open.
Now the exclusionary rule still exists,
but it's actually been cut back.
So it's the one area where courts
in American culture actually have been a
little sceptical of the Warren court.
And it's interestingly the one area, I
think, where
the Warren court really kind of made
things up.
so, so here's the bottom line.
It's very interesting.
The critics of the Warren Court is, is
making up all this stuff and here's
and, the, and the defender said who cares
if it is, these are good rules.
Mine's
different.
My defense is different.
In general, the Warren Court was faithful
to the written constitution.
Often, it used the wrong clause.
Voting rights it said equal protection it
should have said the
right to vote is section 2 of the 14th
amendment republican government.
On incorporation, it said due process is
the reason that we incorporate
these rationing in states it should have
said the privileges or immunities clause.
Of the 14th amendment applying
racial equality principles against the
federal government.
It didn't say the first sentence of the
14th amendment.
It doesn't have to state, it just says
equal citizenship.
It didn't always give.
The best arguments are quite, but it
did channel the deep spirit of the
Constitution.
And, and, and one of the reasons that
didn't always give the
best arguments is given the best
arguments would have sometimes required
overruling Presidents.
And, as it was, the Warren Court overruled
a lot or Presidents and
maybe it was afraid to overrule even more
presidents in doing the right thing.
But the amazing thing is, today these very
controversial war and court decisions
actually provide are pretty much accepted
by both sides
of the political spectrum let's take Brown
everyone today thinks Brown is right.
Conservatives as well as liberals
affirmed Brown, liberals say Brown stands
for racial integration and
and robust and educate and the importance
of education and And
equality everywhere and conservatives say
Brown says Government shouldn't be in
the race classification business even when
it comes to affirmative action.
They are both claiming Brown, different
interpretations of Brown.
The conservative one, no affirmative
action,
the liberal one, education and
integration.
Let's take, find the Bill of Rights
against the states.
Conservatives have bought onto that.
They say, oh,by the way, if you're
going to apply free speech and
free exercise and and search and seizure
and compuls, and compulsory processing,
double jeopardy, if you're going to apply
the 1 amendment and the 4th
and the 5th and the 6th and the th against
the States.
The 2nd amendment too please.
Conservatives actually in the Roberts
court applied
the Bill of Rights the second amendment,
read it and individual rights way and
applied it against the States in a case
called city of Chicago versus McDonald.
They're buying into the incorporation
project actually.
Let's take
freedom of speech.
Liberals say Congress
shouldn't target legal aide attorneys that
it doesn't like and defund them.
And conservatives say, well we believe in
free speech too.
Citizens united.
Government shouldn't be manipulating
campaign
finance laws to protect incumbents.
So, both of them are accepting New York
Times versus Sullivan.
We have a kind of a liberal and
conservative
interpretation of New York Times versus
Sullivan.
Let's take voting rights.
Liberals and conservatives both believe in
voting rights.
They had different accounts of that in the
case of Bush versus Gore.
But in Bush versus Gore the republicans on
the court actually were
affirming were, were echoing some of the
voting rights cases the Warren court.
I think they, they were misreading what
some
of those cases said on their facts
perhaps.
But, but they were both conservatives and
liberals pledging allegiance.
To the voting rights cases of the, of the
Warren court.
When it comes to religion, the
conservatives say okay,
we buy the idea that no prayer in public
schools.
But if you really believe in religious
equality,
then we shouldn't be discriminating
against religion either.
And if everyone else gets a voucher for
private schools, religious private schools
should also participate
in the voucher plan.
And if all the other student organized
clubs, then the
Bible study should also be able to meet
after school.
So if the idea is religious liberty then
we shouldn't be discriminating
against religion because that's accepting
the basic precepts of the Warren Court.
We are not going back to organized State
sponsored prayer in the public schools.
So in area after area, with the exception
of the exclusionary rule, actually I think
the court has, has really accepted the
basic teachings of the Warren court.
Here's Earl Warren.
He was and we come back to the pictures.
We always do at the end of chapters.
He was Governor of California.
Big sunny guy.
In Sacramento.
Now when he's Governor of California,
there's I
a youngster in California whose house Earl
Warren
visits multiple times.
This youngster actually, I think is a
state
page, a legislative aide in the California
capital.
In Sacramento, where Earl Warren sort of
presides over everything.
That youngster's name, Anthony Kennedy.
And he's now the Supreme Justice on the
Supreme Court.
And so, and the person of Anthony Kennedy
and in many, many other ways,
I think you see.
The enduring power of the continuity of
the Warren Court
vision in various ways, and again there's
a conservative interpretation and
a liberal interpretation that both sides
actually, in all sorts of
interesting ways, claim the Warren Court,
who would have thunk it.
well, we're not done yet, lots more to
cover, in particular.
Here's the, the key thing about the Warren
court.
It overruled
a ton of precedents.
More precedents, really, than any court
before.
About half as much as as the entire period
before the Warren court.
So in our next couple of lectures, we're
going to try to think about what the
Constitution has to say about precedent
and
what precedent has to say about the
Constitution.
Stay tuned.
