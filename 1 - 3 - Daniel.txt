Hi, my name is Daniel Herz-Roiphe, and I'm
a second-year student here at Yale Law
School.
I'll be one of the teaching assistants
for professor Amar's course on America's
Constitution.
I recently took his course here at the law
school, and I'm
excited to explore many of the same books,
concepts, and ideas with you.
One great way that you'll be able to
participate in this course, in addition to
viewing the weekly lectures and
participating in
the discussion forum, is by submitting
writing assignments
in which you'll get the chance to explore
some of the ideas
of the course on your own and have them
reviewed by your peers.
It's a great way to engage more with the
material,
and I look forward to seeing some of your
work.
