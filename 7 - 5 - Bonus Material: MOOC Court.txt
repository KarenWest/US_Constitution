Hi, welcome to the Week Six bonus
materials
for Professor Kelm Mars Constitutional Law
Class on Coursera.
I'm Daniel, one of your teaching
assistants.
And along with me here, is Danny.
Another one of the teaching assistants.
Today we're going to talk a little about,
what
constitutional law looks like in the
modern world today.
And we're going to do that by discussing a
couple of important court cases that
involve constitutional law.
That are being decided this year in the
United States Supreme Court.
So just to lead things off, I thought I'd
talk a little about
what the Supreme Court is, and how it
functions in the American legal system.
So the Supreme Court is the highest court
in the United States.
And while it hears some well in some cases
its a part of original jurisdiction.
Like here's here's cases for the first
time.
In almost every case it hears, its a court
of appeals.
So its going to be hearing cases that have
already been decided in other
courts and determining whether those
courts made
the right decision or the wrong decision.
And now the way you get into the
Supreme Court, is by a complicated process
called certiorari.
So after you lost a case in a lower court,
you can petition the Supreme Court and
say, hey, I think that the lower court got
it wrong, I want you to review this case.
And thousands and thousands of people
every year do this.
And the Supreme Court only agrees to hear
about 70 of those cases.
And they're the cases that present the
most interesting, the
most compelling issues, have caused the
most disagreement in lower courts.
But with those 70 cases then, it will have
each party.
In, in the Supreme Court, the parties are
called the petitioner,
who's the person challenging the lower
court ruling, and the respondent.
Who's the person responding, and who won
below.
Each of them will present briefs, so
that's written summaries of what their
arguments are.
And then each of them will get a chance to
present
oral arguments, before the justices in
which they can make their case.
After the justices hear oral arguments,
they will discuss with each other
what they're going to do and eventually
come to a ruling and the majority.
Will get to write an opinion saying what
the court is doing and why they're doing
it.
Other judges who disagree can write either
concurrences, in which
they say "I agree with the result you came
to.
But I want to get a slightly different
reasoning for it.
Or dissents, in which they say, I don't
agree with the result.
Here's what I think should happen instead.
So that process goes on.
The Supreme Court calendar runs from
October through June, basically
and hearing cases and then deciding them
as they go.
And so, we're going to talk about a few of
them today.
>> Thanks, Daniel.
So one of the things that's important to
realize is that, in this
Supreme Court process, not everything that
the Supreme Court does is constitutional
law.
There are plenty of cases that are about
things other than the Constitution.
For instance, statues that are laws passed
by
Congress or regulations that are passed by
federal agencies.
The Supreme Court will.
And determine what the authoritarian
interpretation of
a statute is, or it will determine whether
an agency's action or regulation is in
line with the statutory authority granted
by congress.
but, in keeping with their course, we
decided to take a few
cases from this term that are about
specific parts of The Constitution.
Specific texts within The Constitution,
and.
About how those text have been interpreted
by
the Supreme Court and other courts over
time.
So, today we're going to talk about three
cases.
first, the national labor relations board
versus Noah Canning
which is a case that deals with article
two section
two of the constitution, and then we'll
talk about
United States versus Worry, which deals
with the fourth amendment.
And finally, the town of Greece versus
Galloway, which is about the first
amendment.
>> So, the first case that were talking
about today is,
national labor relations board or NLRB for
short, versus Noah Canning.
So as Danny said, this case arises under
article two section two.
And now, if you remember, from chapters
four and
five, of professor Lamar's book and the
lectures that.
Correspond to that.
Article two is about the President and the
powers that the President has.
Now one of the most important powers that
the President has is the power of
appointment.
So this is what the Constitution has to
say about Presidential appointments.
This is in article two, section two.
He, that's the President.
They weren't really thinking of female
President's at the time I guess, shall
have power by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, to
to make Treaties.
So that part of the clause is not relevant
here.
But then also.
To appoint Ambassadors, other Public
Ministers and consuls, Judges
of the Supreme Court, and all other
officers of
the United States, whose appointments are
not herein otherwise
provided for and which shall be
established by law.
And then it says, in the next clause, so
that's, that's setting up the primary
mechanism for appointment,
which says, the President's going to make
a nomination, but
then the Senate has to provide advice and
consent.
It has to agree with the nomination the
President's giving.
But, then there's a catch which is that in
the next paragraph it says, the President
shall have power to fill up all vacancies
that may happen during the recess of the
Senate.
By granting commissions which shall expire
at the end of the next session.
So this is, this is what, this is called
the recess appointment clause.
So and it establishes a recess appointment
power.
You may have heard about recess
appointments
but basically they're appointments that
the president makes.
When Congress, when the Senate is in
recess.
When it's not meeting and they last for
just a year.
Until the beginning of the next Senate
session.
It's a temporary appointments that don't
require the consent of the Senate.
So the [SOUND] The case of Noah Kennedy,
the
NLRB concerns how far that recess
appointment power goes.
specifically, it relates to a few
appointments that
President Obama made to the National Labor
Relations Board.
And he made them as recess appointments,
and this was back in January of 2012.
And you know he said well Congress isn't
in section.
I want to point these people to the
National Labor Relations Board so I'm
just going to do it and I don't need the
advising consent of the Senate.
After he did that some people said wait a
second.
We don't think you actually, we don't
think this was a real recess.
We, we think, oh sorry.
They made actually a whole variety of
claims,
one in which was, this wasn't a real
recess.
But another of which, was, and this is the
one that we're actually going to actually
talk about today.
So if you remember, the text that I read
to you said, the
President shall have the power to fill up
all the vacancies that may happen.
During the recess of the Senate.
So one question that arises is, does that
mean that he has to make the
appoint, just mean that he has to make
the appointment during the recess of the
Senate?
Or does it mean the vacant seat that he's
filling, actually has to arise during that
Senate recess, too?
And that's one of the questions that's
being litigated in [UNKNOWN].
And so what we're going to do here is
Danny's going to lay out the position of
one side.
And then I'm going to respond and lay out
the position of the other.
So you get a sense about what both the
arguments are.
So Danny will start by telling us about
the petitioner.
And that's the government, in this case.
Says about the racist point in this class.
>> Right.
So, the petitioner in this case is the
National Labor Relations Board.
That's because they lost in the lower
court, which in
this case was the appeals court in D.C.,
the D.C. Circuit.
So, the National Labor Relations Board
cares about this very much because
it's currently headed up by people who
were appointed via this method.
In January 2012, as Daniel said So the
question is whether the
actions that these people have taken,
while in office are valid actions.
And that's really the underlying cause of
complaint.
In, in the case today that we're
discussing today.
It was actually argued back in January,
although we're still
waiting to hear from the court what the
decision will be.
So there's a variety of arguments that are
on the table, that the government is
making, a
lot of which you might recognize in sort
of
style or pattern from the discussions
we've been having.
In class so far and in Professor Marr's
lectures.
Some of these arguments are sort of,
textual arguments.
About what the word happen means.
And to look at the text the government's
briefs are looking at
how the word happen was construed and how
the word recess was construed.
Back in 17, in the 1780s and the 1790s
around the time.
Of the writing and ratification of the
Constitution.
So some of the sources that the
government has used are records from
British Parliament.
[SOUND] Or records from state legislatures
and how they
use the terms recess or how they handled
recess appointments.
The continental Congress or even how
the constitutional convention handled its
parliamentary procedure.
Another set of arguments is related to the
purpose of the bots, you know, What the
[UNKNOWN] clause was designed to do and if
you look at historical historical evidence
from the time.
You see people talking about the [UNKNOWN]
clause as designed to make
sure that the government was still
functioning while the Senate was in
recess.
And you know, nowadays the recesses
between sessions of the Senate.
Not particularly long.
They may be a month, maybe a few weeks,
maybe a couple of months.
But back in the 1790s [INAUDIBLE] during
the
first Congresses, often recesses were six
months long.
And the recess appointment clause was seen
as
a fundamental way to keep the government
functioning.
To keep executive offices filled when the
senate was not in session to confirm it.
So one of the argument's the government
makes is that, with this
purpose in mind think again about what it
means to have a rule
that the vacancies that are being filled
by the President had to
exist during the recess or they could have
arisen before the recess commenced.
And think about, for instance, a vacancy
that's created because.
Let's say a military officer dies two days
before the Senate goes into recess.
And word doesn't make it to the Senate, or
the Senate doesn't have the
time, to confirm a new appointment by the
President before it goes into recess.
Now that would be a vacancy that arose
before the recess happened.
But it seems like if the purpose of the
clause is to allow the government
to keep the, is to allow the President
to keep the government functioning during
the recess.
You would certainly think that, having
important military positions filled would
be a necessary thing for the president to
be able to do.
So that's sort of an argument based on
the, the purpose of the clause.
Then there are arguments about the history
of how this clause has been interpreted.
So one thing you might think when you
read this clause again, that the President
shall
have power to fill up all vacancies that
may happen during the recess of the
Senate.
You might think, well, it's not clear what
the word happen means.
Does the word happen mean arise?
Does the word happen mean exist?
So how should we handle moments when the
constitutional text is, is unclear?
And one of the things that the Obama
administration is arguing is that we
should look
to historical practice, to see if this is
subverting an understanding that has
existed for centuries.
And they say no.
No it's not.
It's unsurprising that they say that, of
course.
They say nearly all Presidents have, have
made appointments to pre-existing
vacancies, to vacancies.
That arose while the Senate was in
session, but
the appointment was made while the Senate
was in recess.
They also point to letters from
the Attorney General to the President
interpreting
the President's authority to do this
dating back all the way to 1823.
And they say, they note how many officers
have been appointed this
way, it's hundreds and hundreds of
officers over history, both civilian
officers.
And military officers.
And so they say, alright, you know?
Even if this maybe an ambiguous text.
We should see that this has been, you
know, worked
into the fabric of our constitution over
the last couple centuries.
This is a kind of argument that we'll see
a lot as we transition into
the next half of the course with
Professor [INAUDIBLE], as he discusses
American's unwritten constitution.
You'll get, several lectures dealing with
what Professor [INAUDIBLE] calls.
Americans institutional constitution and
that's the,
the interpretations of our constitution,
the
gloss that's been added onto the text by
centuries of executive practice.
>> Thanks.
So, Noel Canning on the other hand, and
that's the respondent in this case
says, look, I know we've been doing things
this way for a long time.
I know for, you know, 150 years,
presidents have been appointing.
officials, to vacancies that only came
about before the recess.
But it doesn't matter, because the text of
the constitution is clear.
Now, as I said before, what the text of
Article one,
Section two, sorry Article two, Section
two, Clause three actually says is.
That the President has the power to fill
vacancies that happen during the recess.
Now the most natural meaning of the word
happen, whether today
or in fact, back when The Constitution was
originally written in 1787.
Is that it refers to a sudden occurrence
rather than a state of being.
If you talk about something happening in
everyday speech.
You're not really talking about something
that's been around for months.
You talking, if, if you say, you know,oh I
went back home and my mother happened to
be there.
Right.
You know, you're not talking about your
mother having been there for six months.
You're saying my mother was there at the
moment that I got there.
And the most natural way to read, as
a result, you know, vacancies that shall
happen during
the recess, is that we're talking about
vacancies
that come to exist when we're in the
recess.
And not vacancies that came about, you
know, months or even years beforehand.
And related to this textual argument is.
Another purpose argument.
So Danny gave you one purpose argument
was, which was, well, you know, the
recess appointments clause is about making
sure
that the government can continue to
function.
So it's important to give the President
broad powers to make recess appointments.
But another response is, well, the recess
appointments
clause is really supposed to be a special
exception.
For times when the normal appointments
process,
with the President nominating and the
senate confirming.
Can't work.
And, you know, if we give the president
the power to make recess
appointments for nominations that, I'm
sorry,
for vacancies that have existed for
months.
Well, then he's really never going to go
to the Senate at all, right.
If the President knows, you know, I don't
have, this vacancy came about in the
middle
of the Senate's term but if I just wait a
few months until the Senate is.
Out of Washington.
I can appoint whoever I want to that seat,
without needing the senate's consent.
Then why is he ever going to use
the normal appointment's clause process of
advising consent.
And so in a way interpreting the recess
appointment clause broadly, might actually
undermine the purpose,
not just of that clause but of the
whole appointment scheme that the
constitution is setting up.
And then finally with regards to some of
these history arguments,
the respondent say, you know it's not
really all that clear, yet.
Its true that Presidents were for a long
time
have been appointing officials who's
vacancies came about before recess
began, but at the very beginning of our
country's
history it was unclear that that was the
accepted practice.
George Washington for example felt that it
was really important that you could only
use the Recess Pointman's Clause to fill
vacancies that actually arose during the
recess.
And so it's unclear whether a historical
practice
that only started several decades after
the founding should
really carry as much weight, as the one
that's been continuous since the beginning
of our history.
So those are some of the arguments, that
both sides are laying out, and if you're
curious
to learn more, there's tons of material on
the internet that you can read about this
case.
You can look at the briefs and you can
read the transcripts
of the argument, but now we can move on to
some other stuff.
>> Great.
So the next case we wanted to talk about
is United States versus Worry.
And this is a case about the fourth
amendment.
So just as a refresher I'll read the text
of the fourth amendment.
And the fourth amendment says, the right
of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects against unreasonable searches
and seizures.
Shall not be violated and no warrants
shall
issue but upon probably cause supported by
oath or
affirmation and particularly describing
the place to be
searched and the person or things to be
seized.
So the fourth amendment is an incredibly
important part of the Constitution through
law enforcement.
And the question before the court in
United States
versus Worry is whether when a person is
being arrested.
Can the police search that person's cell
phone if
they don't have a warrant to search the
cell phone?
And can they look at data that they might,
may gather from, from the cell phone?
So in this particular case the defendant
was the defendant was
observed during what police officers
believed to be a drug sale.
And they arrested the man and they
searched his phone, which led to more
in, which led to more information for the
crime, for them to prosecute him.
United States versus Wurie is also being
argued the same day as another case,
United States versus Riley, in which the
defendant there was driving with expired
plates.
And he was pulled over for that crime of
driving with expired plates.
And the police searched his phone.
In one of these cases the phone that was
searched was a a flip phone.
A cell phone with, that's you know, got a
flip and they looked at the call records.
In another case it was a sma, in the other
one of the cases it was a smart phone.
And smart phones, as many of us know, have
huge amounts of data on them.
So the question is, you know, this text in
the fourth, the fourth amendment.
The persons, houses, papers and effects.
Does that apply to a cell phone?
And and it's, it's a tricky question,
right?
Because cell phones didn't exist at the
time the Constitution was written, and so
this
is an, an important case for, for the
Supreme Court to be considering this term.
>> So, the government in the worry case
at least is the petitioner.
They lost.
In the, in the corbulo.
The appeals court said this was
unreasonable
search of his phone, under the fourth
amendment.
But here in the supreme court, they're
arguing that shouldn't have been the case.
And what this really turns on is, so, as
Danny read in the text of the
fourth amendment, it doesn't say that the
government
can't engage in any searches without a
warrant.
It says the government can't engage in
unreasonable searches, without a warrant.
The question is.
You know, what, what what's a, what's an
unreasonable search?
What's a reasonable search?
And the way that the court tends to figure
that out, because the text doesn't really
say, you know.
It doesn't really say, oh, and these are
examples
of searches the government can do without
a warrant.
These are examples of searches the
government can't do without a warrant.
So the way that the court kind of fills in
the details is by looking at precedent.
By looking at past court opinions on this
subject.
This is something that we'll discuss a lot
more actually when we move to the second
half
of the course which we're just getting to
now
and Professor [INAUDIBLE] our second book
America's Unwritten Constitution.
So anyway, when you look at the precedents
on you know, searches incident to an
arrest.
So what can I, what can I do when I, if
the police arrest someone.
What are they allowed to look at, even if
they don't have a warrant?
A lot of the courts holdings say, well,
you
know what you can do is you can look at
anything that's on the arrested persons
body, you can,
you can, I mean which, which start to make
sense.
I mean you can search you make sure they
don't have any weapons,
you can see what kind of personal effects
they have on them when.
When you're, when you're arresting them.
So, the government argues, that really
should apply to people's phones to.
I mean, the cell phone is something that
you're
carrying when you're arrested and so, if,
if, if our
doctrine, if our cases say you're allowed
to search
what's on a person's, you know, body when
they're arrested.
Then that's gotta involve their cell phone
too.
Especially because, espec, in the modern
world cell
phones are particularly likely to contain
evidence of criminality.
Indeed, that's why this case is in court.
Because the police were able to discover
valuable evidence, about
where he's drug dealing when when they
searched his phone.
And and as a result the, the government
claims
this is, you know, in line with our
doctrine.
A totally reasonable search.
And that it's no more intrusive, really,
than other
searches the police might do for stuff
that you're carrying.
For example, suppose you had a diary in
your pocket.
The police can look at your diary.
Why is that more intrusive, than the
police looking through your phone?
And so, what the government basically says
is, like, if you want,
if you want to put someone that's on this,
you could monitor this.
Scope of how much we can look at in a
[UNKNOWN] but it it
really doesn't make sense to say we have a
categorical rule that says no phones.
That's not consistent with all of the
cases that say its
okay to search what's on your phone when
we arrest you.
>> And I, then of course there's
there's
the arguments made by by [UNKNOWN] in his
defence and its important to note that the
respondent brief was brief in this case
was actually.
Not yet been filed.
The arguments aren't happening until late
April of this year
and so the course, the code, the case is
still underway.
You can, you can think about the kinds of
argument that would like to be made based
on
the arguments that have been made below or
the
arguments that have been made in certain
similar cases.
Which are that you know, yes as Daniel
said, there are there
are all sorts of reasonable things for
police to, to search and take.
When they're, when they're making an
arrest.
You know, a pat-down to see if you have a
gun or a knife on you is
certainly a reasonable thing for, for a
police officer
to be doing in, in the course of duty.
But phones are sort of different.
And, as Daniel noted, this is, this is,
this isn't something that
we can get just from the text of, of the
fourth amendment.
In part, we have to look to.
To doctrines that the supreme court has
developed over
time, as technology has changed and as
policing has changed.
And one of the things about especially a
smartphone is that it's
a little bit, there are elements of it
that are like a diary.
But there are also elements of it that are
like, you know,
your entire computer, all of your business
transactions, access to your email.
And then also for instance if police hold
on to the
phone for a while, while they're
questioning you they can see.
Incoming calls and he's trying to talk to
you and
hear the voicemails that they might be
leaving for you.
And all of these things are maybe similar
to phone calls, which the
Supreme Court has put restrictions on, the
police's ability to listen in on.
Or they may be similar to the papers and
business effects that the [INAUDIBLE]
seems to be concerned with.
And, so you know, there really is.
It's, it's interesting because fourth
amendment doctrine can
sort of push and pull on both these areas.
And as we'll see in the next, in the next
few weeks.
Professor Mar will go over it.
In particular the ruins of the Warren
Court.
Which he has, which, many things to say
about, some good and some bad.
And worry looks like it will just be the
latest in a long run of.
Complicated fourth amendment
jurisprudence.
>> So the last case that we wanted
to discuss today called Town of Greece v
Galloway.
And this case arises under the First
Amendment of the United
States Constitution, which might be the
most famous of them all.
And what it says is, Congress shall make
no law
respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
Or abridging the freedom of speech or of
the press or of the right of
the people peaceably to assemble and to
petition the government for redress of
their grievances.
So, the first amendment as you can tell,
contains a lot of really important stuff.
Freedom of speech, freedom of the press,
freedom to
assemble but what we're concerned with in
this case.
Is that first part.
And that said that Congress shall make
no law concerning the establishment of a
religion.
So Congress, Congress is never going to
say,
the United States is a Christian country.
The United States, you know, is a catholic
country.
A protestant country.
A Jewish country.
Muslim Country.
You know?
That is outlawed under the first
amendment.
so.
It's easy to say something like, the
United
States could never declare an official
state religion.
But there are a lot of situations where it
seems a little more complicated.
Where it's not totally is what the United
States.
Is what the, not just the federal
government,
but the state governments, too, is what
they're doing.
Equivalent to saying, well, you know, we
really
have an official religion or is it totally
permissible.
And one case where this comes up is
legislative prayer.
So as you might know, lots of
legislative bodies in the United States
have chaplains.
And have prayers.
That are given before a session.
The United States Congress for example,
has a chaplain, who
will lead people in a prayer often before
Congress meets.
And a lot of state legislatures, like town
legislatures have the same thing.
And over the years various people have
said, you know, this seems
a little funny that first amendment says
there's no establishment of religion.
But here we are, we're using public funds
to pay ministers, to lead congressmen in
prayers.
That seems to, that feels a little like we
do have an official religion.
But the court generally said, no, this is
okay.
In particular there's a famous case called
Marsh v Chambers.
Where, someone challenged legislative
prayer and the court said.
You know, this is really acceptable.
It's acceptable because, you know, the
prayers
here aren't really sectarian, it's more
general.
We're accepting a lot of kind of general
faith
traditions and not clearly promoting or
denigrating anyone's religion.
And then also, this is just part of who we
are.
We've been doing legislative prayer since
the beginning of
our country and, you know, we're religious
people and
it's okay to have a reflection of that as
long as the prayers aren't too kind of
clearly sectarian.
So that's been the law for a number of
years now, but
town of Greece legality brings up a
slightly new application of it.
Town of Greece legality is about not
state legislature, the national
legislature of congress.
It's about a, a local, town board, and at
their town board meetings,
they would have, um,various clergy men get
up to give a prayer at the beginning.
And.
You know, a town board meeting is a
little different than your average
legislative session, so
this wasn't just the the minister leading
people,
you know, ele, elected officials in a
prayer.
He's leading the whole group, the whole
audience.
Lots of people come to town meetings.
In order to in order to you know, bring a
petition or discuss a permit grant or
anything like that.
So the question is, is this like Marching
chambers?
Is this like, all the situations of
legislative prior that the
court has said are totally acceptable or
is this somehow different?
>> So the town of Greece in this case
is the petitioner.
And you know, [SOUND] that means they,
they lost in the court
below and are getting the supreme court to
reconsider that decision, and.
One of the first arguments that they rely
on
is essentially saying this is just like
Marsh B.Chambers.
It's a, it's an argument about the
historical tradition of towns across the
United
States, which, just like the federal
legislature,
have often had prayers that start
meetings.
And so the argument is sort of.
If it's, if it's all right for the
legislature, the federal legislature
to do this in large part because of this
long-standing American tradition.
Then it should be all right for towns to
do this.
And because of this long-standing American
tradition as well.
But that doesn't, you know, get
necessarily to everything
that, that Daniel raised about the, the
dissimilarity between.
Congress and town meetings, which in town
meetings maybe somewhat more involve
the people of the town meeting, somewhat
more involve non elected officials.
And so there's, then there's worry also
about those people getting
a message about the government's
endorsement of one religion or another.
And whether that violates the
establishment clause of the first
amendment.
And the town responds, you know, that
there's not just.
The phrase of the first amendment that
says, Congress
shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religions.
There's also the part that says, Congress
shall
make no law prohibiting the free exercise,
thereof.
And the town of Greece says that the, that
the, part of the purpose of
the first amendment is to ensure the
freedom
of worship and [INAUDIBLE] in the United
States.
And here this prayer session is, is a way
of, way of doing that.
And it also says there aren't really the
same the same worries about an
establishment of religion.
Because the, the town allows volunteers
from
all kinds of faith or non-faith
persuasions to.
To come and lead and lead a [INAUDIBLE]
at the beginning of, of each ceremony,
sorry, meeting.
So for instance, just in the last year,
they've had members of the Jewish
faith, Catholic faith, Mormon faith,
Buddhist faith,
the High faith, Wicken faith and many
more.
And they've never rejected, any request by
somebody.
And they also don't look at the text that
the person chooses to read.
Beforehand, to approve it.
So they say, you know, if, if the first
amendment.
If you look at the purpose of the first
amendment,
worry, the framers were worried about
establishing a National Church.
The government saying, this religion is
the religion of the state.
And you know, they're saying look at the
way this is practiced.
This is practiced as a reflection of the
diverse states of many Americans.
We don't reject anyone and we've taken all
comers
and we let them say what they want to say.
And it's resulted in diverse
presentations.
And so they say if you look at really
really the first amendment,
you shouldn't think of this as
questionable about the establishment of a
religion.
It's not an establishment of religion and
it's allowing people.
Moreover, to, express a variety and
diversity of religious viewpoints.
>> So, the, the respondents in this
case, and that's Galilei, he, who was
a person who, attended some of these town
meetings, he didn't like the prayer.
[SOUND] Says first off that all this talk
about
including a variety of faith traditions is
a little fishy.
Because for the vast majority of prayer
sessions is Christian
ministers giving explicitly prayers with
very kind of sectarian language.
And then at the end, once some of the
complaints are heard, once there's the
threat of litigation.
All of a sudden the town [LAUGH] men
offered to bring
in a Baha'i, to bring in Wiccan, to bring
in Jewish.
But, but, but it was clear, at least for
most of the history of this practice,
what was going on, and that was that
the town was engaging in explicitly
Christian prayers.
An interesting thing actually, if, if
you're
curious to hear some of the content of
these prayers is go look at the transcript
for the oral arguments in this case.
In which Justice Kagan, who's one of the
justices
in the Supreme Court, did a really
fascinating thing.
And at the very beginning of the oral
argument, when the Town of Greece's lawyer
was about
to start, she cut him off and she
said, suppose at the beginning of this
court session.
The chief justice had said, and then she
recited one of these prayers, you
know, which has a lot of references to
Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior and.
Christian doctrine, said you know, would
that have been okay?
And that's a really though question to
answer, because its certainly sounds when
you're hearing
this, like this isn't necessarily about
bringing
in every faith tradition, this is about
saying.
We believe in a particular faith
tradition,
and that's you know, what our towns
endorsing.
[SOUND] And then I, the second they'd
point that the that the town
increase some, sorry that the, that the
respondents are going to make is that.
What the town of Greece is doing is really
not like Marsh v.
Chambers at all.
It's not like typical legislative prayer,
and
that's because it has a coercive effect.
That, if members of a legislature don't
like a Prayer,
don't want to participate, you know, they
don't have to.
But when, individual citizens are coming
before a town board.
To petition it, to try to get it to
do something they want, to participate in
their government.
When they're sitting next to their friends
and neighbors and a minister
gets up and asks the whole town to
participate in a prayer.
They're going to feel really uncomfortable
walking out, or sitting down when everyone
rises, or refusing to bow their heads in
prayer when everybody else does.
And that, that kind of coercion is what
the establishment clause is about for, for
protecting against.
Right?
The establishment clause is supposed to
say, government can't force people,
to adhere to any particular religion or
participate in any religious ceremony.
And that's really what's going on in this
setting in a way
that's totally different from other
legislative
prayer contexts that the Court is
considering.
So, I hope you enjoyed hearing about some
of
the arguments in three of these Supreme
Court cases.
And as Danny mentioned earlier, none of
the
opinions from these cases have come down
yet.
So it's a, open question what's actually
going to happen?
And it'll be really fascinating to, to
see.
But so we're excited to see what happens
and we
hope you've enjoyed talking about these
cases with us today.
Thanks so much.
>> Have a good time.
We'll see you at the next Interactive
Session.
