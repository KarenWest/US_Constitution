[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
In our previous sessions, we talked
about the Constitution's first sentence,
the preamble
and its great themes of democracy and
geography.
We, the People, the democratic idea of the
United States, a geographic idea.
Today, we're going to begin a conversation
about the next section in
textual order of the Constitution: Article
One.
Article One is about the legislature,
about Congress.
And we'll begin our conversation by
talking about the basic structure of
Congress.
And then later on we'll start to talk
about some of the powers of Congress.
Here are some of the big themes.
They're the big themes, really, of, of the
preamble.
Democracy, geography, we're also going to
talk about slavery and how it was
built into the structure of Congress, and
into the structure of Article One.
We the People of the United States.
Who isn't counted, or who's counted
in unusual ways, distinctive ways,
important ways?
Those are going to be some of the things
we'll talk about in our
conversation about the basic structure of
Congress before we move on to conversation
about the powers of Congress.
So,
couple things.
One, size matters.
We talked about how the preamble was
printed in broader ty, in bigger type
than the rest of the Constitution when
various newspaper publishers
ran copies of the Constitution when the
document went public.
Size matters, here, also.
We have on the screen a picture of the
congressional building in 1846.
This is the first photograph of the
Capitol building.
And I hope you notice, just, quick
inspection, it's
large and we're going to talk about why
it's large.
The White House, for example, is not
large.
So, what's up with that?
Why is the Capitol building large and the
White House, not so large?
We'll also talk about location.
The preamble came first in the document,
locationally.
And I thought that was and continue to
think that's significant.
It's first because it's particular
importmant particularly important.
Why is the legislature Article One?
Why is Congress Article One?
Why is that located in the text where it
is?
Article One is also not just the, the
first article in the Constitution, it's
the longest.
So textually its size is, I think, a, an
interesting indication of significance, as
well as the size of the building itself.
Let's start with the word, Congress.
Why did they pick that word?
Well at one level it's designed to ease
people's minds.
Oh, this is the same word that we've used
for the preeminent body under the Articles
of Confederation.
there, the, the central organ of, of
federal power,
under the Articles Confederation, was
known as the Congress.
And so they used the same word in the
Constitution.
Just as they used the phrase the United
States, in the Confederation, the
Articles of Confederation, and they used
that
phrase, the United States, in the
Constitution.
But in the Constitution, the United States
means something a lot, a little different.
It's far more united than it was under the
Articles of Confederation.
Remember, under the Articles of
Confederation, that
was just a league or a kind
of treaty and, and states were, in the
end, free to, to leave that league or
treaty.
Eleven states, in effect, left the
Articles of Confederation, to form
the Constitution, initially leaving Rhode
Island and, and North Carolina behind.
So the United States, under the Articles
of Confederation, are sort
of a looser entity, more of a league, a
confederation, a treaty.
That very same phrase, the United States,
in the Constitution, means something much
stricter.
Once you're in, you're in, for
geostrategic
reasons that we talked about in previous
sessions.
So, too, this word Congress, it's a
gesture back toward
the Articles of Confederation, but it
means something rather different.
In the Articles of Confederation, there
was
one body that basically wielded all
central power.
In the Constitution, Congress is merely
one of three
bodies that are the central federal
organs.
There's Article One but there's going to
be an Article
Two, the Presidency, and an Article Three,
the judiciary.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the,
the document doesn't
even describe the Congress, quote
congress, as a legislature.
It doesn't describe the output of that
body as law.
Law that would be binding on every court
in
America, state or federal.
The Articles of Confederation don't say
that.
The Constitution will, actually, describe,
and Article One does
describe, Congress as a legislature, as a
law making body.
And so that's one important difference.
And and, and Congress
is going to be vested in, in Article One
with legislative power, as distinct from
executive power, in Article Two, vested in
the president, and
judicial power, in Article Three, vested
in federal courts.
Now this idea of Congress as a lawmaking
body is a little different than Congress
under the Articles of Confederation.
There, Congress was more al, almost of an
executive council, a war council.
And it wasn't so obvious that, basically,
it made law as such.
now, the Articles of Confederation said
that Congress would
only have certain powers that were
expressly given to it.
That word doesn't appear in the
Constitution.
Congress, under this new body, they have
it, powers expressly and impliedly given
to it.
So that's going to be another
important difference.
And we'll talk about that in later
sessions, when we
begin to talk about the particular powers
of, of Congress.
And, by the way, some of those powers are
new powers, vast new powers to directly
raise an army, a central army, to have
taxes imposed directly on individuals.
To regulate interstate commerce and
foreign affairs to regulate
federal territories.
So, these are to monitor whether each
state has a Republican form of government.
These are going to be vast new powers
given to this new Congress.
And by the way, when we look at this
picture, we see there,
kind of, are two wings of Congress, it's
going to be a bicameral body.
There's going to be a house of
representatives, and a senate.
That's different than the Articles of
Confederation, where you
had a unicameral body called Congress.
Now the Senate, in some ways, is going to
look a little like the old Congress under
the Articles of Confederation.
It's given a new name, it's now called a
Senate, and
that new name suggests a little bit more
independence and detachment.
Here are the ways the Senate looks like
the old Congress under the Articles of
Confederation.
Each state,
whether it has a lot of people
or few people, is going to be equally
represented.
and, the Senate is going to be picked by
state
legislatures, as was the Congress in the
Articles of Confederation.
So the Senate is, in a way, the
continuation of the Congress in
the Articles of Confederation, but even it
is going to be different in several ways.
It has a different name and a name
suggesting more independence
from state legislatures.
And indeed, this new Senate is going to
have a
much longer term, six years rather than a
single year.
These new senators are going to be
eligible to, for, for perpetual
reelection.
There were mandatory term limits under the
Articles of Confederation.
You had to rotate out, every few years,
unless you'd become
too attached to the national government
under the Articles of Confederation.
But on
the Constitution, you can be a senator,
basically, for, for decades.
This new Senate is will be immune from
legislative recall.
Whereas in the old Articles of
Confederation, the Senate
was like a set of ambassadors that were
sent
to the, to the, the na, the national
capitol,
and they could be recalled at anytime by
their state
legislative masters.
This new Senate's going to be directly
paid by the national government.
so, in all these ways, the, the new
Congress
is, is is different than, than, than the
old Congress.
Of course, the House of Representatives is
going to be directly elected by voters.
That wasn't true, of any part of,
of government under the Articles of
Confederation.
There wasn't direct participation
by the people in, in the old Congress, but
there will be direct participation in this
new body.
So, in short, the old Congress was a
collection of state's
men, and the new Congress is going to be
an assembly of statesmen.
so, let's talk, just a little bit, about
this bicameral idea, the idea
that something is going to have to pass
both House and Senate in order to be law.
That bicameral idea, built on state
constitutions, most of which
had legislators with two houses.
Pennsylvania didn't, Georgia didn't,
but in all the other colonies turned
states, there were bicameral legislators.
Mimicking perhaps, the, the system in
Great Britain,
where there was a, a bicameral of
parliament.
A House of Commons and a corresponding
House
of Lords, a lower house and an upper
house.
So, those are basic models for the new
Federal Government, the English model, the
State Constitutional
model, and they're going to have bicameral
legislature.
So you might think, oh they're doing that
so that there will be fewer laws overall,
because you have to pass both the House
and the Senate in order to become a law.
But, a bicameral legislature doesn't
automatically guarantee fewer laws.
Yes, if the House wants law A, and the
Senate wants law B, maybe nothing passes.
But maybe, you get a big log-roll, in
which the House and the Senate
kind of mush, throw everything into one
big package and you get A and B.
So there's nothing, necessarily, in a
bicameral body
that will mean fewer laws rather than more
laws.
also, by the way, if a certain bad law is
on the books if
bicameralism did make it harder to pass a
new law, well, maybe then you're
stuck with some old laws that you don't
like.
So, I'm not sure that the conventional
view, that bicameralism
is about the idea of less law, fewer laws,
makes sense.
But here's one, I think, a thing that
they, that they did believe.
That a bi camera legislature would pass
fewer arguably unconstitutional laws.
Because if either
House or Senate thinks that a law is
unconstitutional, it
should just say no, and never vote for it,
and
not vote for it even as part of any
log-roll,
because they've taken oaths of office to
support the Constitution.
And it would dishonorable, it would be a
violation of
that oath idea, to vote for an arguably
unconstitutional law.
And so, if either the House or the Senate
thinks that the laws are arguably
unconstitutional, then maybe it doesn't
pass.
If either the House or the Senate thinks
that a law
is deeply unjust, well, then maybe that's
something you can't log-roll about.
so, I'm not sure that you get fewer laws,
overall, with a bicameral legislature.
I think the idea, though, was you
get fewer arguably unconstitutional or
arguably unjust laws.
And of course, it's not just the
House and the Senate who are going to
weigh in on that, the president, if
he thinks, independently, that a law's
unconstitutional,
he's going to be able to veto that.
We'll talk about that more when we get to
the presidency, which is Article Two of
the Constitution.
Course, we'll also, when we get to Article
Three
of the Constitution, the judiciary, talk
about how the judiciary
can, in effect, nullify a law through a
thing
called judicial review if it thinks that
law is unconstitutional.
So, even if the House thinks it's okay
constitutionally, and even if
the Senate thinks it's okay uncon,
constitutionally, that doesn't end the
conversation.
The President's still going to, typically,
need to sign it or else have his
veto overridden by two thirds of each
House, we'll talk about that more.
And of course they're going to be able to
weigh in.
Okay, so that's a little bit on the basic
structure of a bicameral legislature.
And you see that bicameralism, just in
this picture here, a House and a Senate.
Now, I said size matters
and, and you see that this is a very big
building.
Why is that?
Why is it so much bigger than, let's say,
the White House?
It's vastly bigger than Independence Hall,
for that matter.
If you've ever been to Washington D.C.,
you know what
I'm talking about because this is, this is
a massive structure.
And, one of the most important issues at
the
founding in this great ratification
conversation that we talked about
in previous sessions, this preamble
conversation, where We the People
of the United States, in the1780s, decide
on the Constitution.
One of the biggest issues was the size of
Congress.
So Article One, early on, says that that
the House of Representatives
will be elected by the people of the
several states.
So the, an echoing of that preamble idea.
And the concern was, if the House of
Representatives was
too small, maybe it really wouldn't be
representative of the people.
And indeed, probably the biggest
objection of skeptics of the Constitution,
the so-called
anti-federalists, probably their, their,
their, their biggest objection
was that the House of Representatives, on
their
view, was too small to be truly
representative.
Their other big anxiety is about the
absence of a bill of rights.
But the absence of a bill of rights is
connected to
this because basically there is a distrust
of the federal government.
And there's
a distrust of the federal government, in
part, because they're
worried that the House of Representatives
won't be representative enough.
So what actually did the Constitution
provide
for the, for the House of Representatives?
It said that there had to be two
senators per state regardless of, of, the
population of, of the state but, for the
House of Representatives, it's going to be
proportioned according to population.
Each state will be guaranteed at least one
member of the House of Representatives.
and, initially the number of members of
the House is not to exceed
a certain number.
and, and they provide for 65 members
of the House of Represenatives before the
first census comes along.
And that there must be at least one
representative per state.
And no more than a certain number of
representatives.
And the anti-federalists say, wait a
minute, you know, you've provided a
maximum
but, but the minimum is one representative
per state?
So, so couldn't a later Congress actually
reduce the size of the House of
Representatives to 13 representatives, one
per state,
make it even smaller than the Senate?
And if you had 13 representatives, that
would mean a quorum is seven?
And that would mean that a majority of the
quorum is four?
And yes,
you've said, we'll have 65 at the
beginning,
but even 65 seems, the anti-federalists
say, really small.
So 65, and that means 33, a simple
majority, would be a quorum?
That would mean 17 people would be a
majority of the quorum.
17 people for the, for the entire
continent?
That making a decision as the so-called
People's House?
65,
wow, that's small, said the
anti-federalists.
Look at state legislatures, only two
states
have, have state assemblies that are that
small.
The Virginia House of, of Delegates is
four times
the size of the, of the U.S. House of
Representatives.
Massachusetts is, is three times.
If you look at, if you count up all of the
state
legislators across the country, there are
1,500 state legislators.
And now, you're proposing that, that same
continent is going to
be governed by a House of Representatives
with a mere 65 members.
They say, look, as a practical matter,
that's going to be way too small.
Only great men with big reputations and
fat wallets are going to be able
to have the name recognition to get
elected over the big, big geographic
districts
that you, that, that you'll have to have
in
order to have a House of Representative so
small.
Our state legislatures have a lot more
people.
They come from the neighborhood.
We know who they are.
They don't go far away, then they come
back.
They're going to be more representative
than this so-called House of
Representatives.
That's what the anti-federalists feared.
And the federalists said, wait a minute,
maybe, maybe we miscalculated.
Yes, we said 65, initially, but that was
just temporarily until the first sentence.
And by the way, here's how we came up with
65.
65 members of the House, plus 26 Senators.
That's, 26 Senators, because two for each
state, that's 91.
That's the size of the Congress under the
Articles of Confederation.
The Articles of Confederation had a
Congress in which each
state sent between two and seven
delegates.
If each state had sent seven, they almost
never did,
but if each state had sent seven, 7 times
13, 91.
And by the way, they almost never show up
under the
Articles of Confederation because a state
gets one vote whether all
seven of its delegates show up or just a
few delegates
show up, so why pay the extra expense for
those extra delegates?
So, we're going to have 91, at the
beginning, and
that's what we have under the Articles of
Confederation.
And those 91
are going to be much more likely to show
up
because every extra Congressperson who
shows up, that's an extra
vote, in the House of Representatives for
that state,
that's an extra vote in the Senate for
that state.
So so if 91's too small, boy, that was a
problem in the Articles of
Confederation, and and these 91 are
going to be more likely to show up.
And and most importantly,
this is just a temporary measure until we
get a new census in place,
and then, the House of Representatives is
going to be much bigger, more
representative, we promise.
Now, if you think the Constitution is just
a piece of paper, the piece
of paper doesn't say that the House
of Representatives is going to get much
bigger, fast.
But if you see the
the Constitution as a deed, as well as a
text, a deed reflecting
this epic conversation that We the People
had in 1787-88.
Part of that deed, part of the deal that,
that
We the People made amongst ourselves is
that the House
of Representatives again, let me remind
you, it talks about
a House of Representatives being elected
by the people of
the several states.
Again, that idea of the people.
We the People of the United States kind
of agreed amongst ourselves that this
House of
Representatives, to be truly
representative of the people,
would need to be much bigger than 65.
And indeed, as soon as a first census came
along, Congress did
get much bigger and, and it's now it's
never gone down to 13.
It's never really shrunk in size, as the
text might have permitted, but as
the deal did not permit.
So, We the People of the United States,
from the preamble, are particularly and
distinctively represented in a House of
Representatives, elected by the people.
and, and one of the biggest issues is this
issue of size.
That's not the only thing that matters,
for the Congress, for the House of
Representatives.
And in our next lecture we're going to
talk about some
of the other important numbers in the
Constitution.
How often are these con, Congressmen
elected?
Who pays their what's their salary and who
pays it?
What sorts of qualifications do they have
to have?
Age qualifications, property
qualifications, or not?
And we'll also begin
to talk about who's not represented.
Who doesn't get to vote in the process.
We'll talk about slavery, so stay tuned.
