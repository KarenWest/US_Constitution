Hi, I'm Danny Townson, one of the TAs for
Professor Lamar's Constitutional Law
class, and I'm back with the
latest in our series of answers to
questions from our
Q and A session just a couple of weeks
ago.
So, first off, we've got a question from
Greg Wilson.
Greg asks, since the Affordable Care Act
has been determined to be
a tax by the Supreme Court, don't we have
a constitutional problem?
The ACA originated in the Senate and the
constitution states, all
bills for raising revenue shall originate
in the House of Representatives.
That's Article one, section seven.
Greg is referring, I think, to an issue
that has been raised in a lawsuit
by Pacific legal foundation called Sissel
versus the
United States department of health and
human services.
That's actually going to be heard by the
DC circuit, which
is a court in DC, in May eighth, on May
eighth.
So just a few weeks from today.
It's a really interesting question.
Article one, section seven, the, part of
the constitution that reads all bills for
raising
revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives,
is appropriately, appropriately enough,
called the origination clause.
The second half of the clause, raises
some, questions about, about Greg's
question, which
is the phrase, the Senate may propose or
concur with amendments as on other bills.
So within this framework what, what does,
what, what
does this framework mean for the
affordable care act?
And the for, for an answer I think one of
the.
[UNKNOWN] Ryan?
>> Yep
>> Can we start over?
>> Yeah, you want, you want to go back all
the way to the beginning.
>> Yeah, totally, I think I just needed a
little warming up.
>> Yeah, no problem.
We're still rolling so.
>> Okay great.

Hi, I'm Danny, one of the TA's for
Professor Amar's Constitutional Law class
here on Coursera.
I'm back this week with more answers from
our most recent Q and A session.
And first up we've got a question from
Greg Wilson.
Greg asks since the Affordable Care Act
had been determined to be
a tax by the Supreme Court, Don't we have
a constitutional problem?
The ACA originated in the Senate, and the
constitution states that
all bills for raising revenue shall
originate in the House of Representatives.
Grey's question is a really interesting
one and
is a question that's actually at the
center of
a recent case that's going to be heard by
the DC Circuit in just a couple of weeks.
That case was brought by the Pacific Legal
Foundation and it's called, and
it's titled, Sissel vs The United States
Department of Health and Human Services.
To answer this question I looked at some
of the writings from
another professor here at Yale, one of
professor Arts colleges Jack Balkin.
Professor Balkin has written about this
case in the Atlantic Monthly
if you want to look at the article for
yourself but also provide
some of the analysis of what Professor
Belkin said in response to
Greg Wilson's question and, in response to
other questions along those lines.
So, just to provide some background from
Greg's question,
the Affordable Care Act, which is
sometimes referred to as
ObamaCare is the large healthcare reform
bill that was passed,
in 2009 and 2010, by the House and the
Senate.
There have been a number of constitutional
challenges to this bill.
And in one of the most high profile ones,
which was called
NFIB versus Seballius, the Supreme Court
determined that one of the reasons the
bill was constitutional in that case, was
that it was enacted under
the con, under Congress's taxing power
rather than under the commerce clause
power.
So Greg's question brings up sort of a
next follow-up question, which is okay,
well, if
it is a tax, the constitution says that
taxes have to originate in the House of
Representatives.
So, since this originated in the Senate,
isn't it unconstitutional for that reason
then?
Didn't the Supreme Court sort of put us in
a, a catch-22 in terms of the bill's
constitutionality?
Now, in order to answer this question,
it's,
I'll go over a little bit of the timeline.
Which is that, on November seventh, 2009,
the House passed a version of
healthcare reform, a bill with many of the
provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
The Senate in response then amended
another recently
passed tax bill, which was referred to as
HR3590.
That bill which had been passed by the
House, was
a, a bill that was completely separate
from healthcare reform.
It was a bill that provided for changes in
the taxation
rules for those in the armed services who
are buying new homes.
So an important issue, but it's very
distinct from, from healthcare reform.
So on December, so the Senate amended that
bill
and deleted all of the texts that had to
do
with service members taxation provisions,
and instead inserted a wholly
new set of texts that was about health
care reform.
On December 24, 2009, the Senate then
passed that newly amended bill.
What's interesting then is that in January
of 2010 after the Senate had
passed that amended bill Scott Brown was
elected the Senator from Massachusetts and
that changed the political configuration
of
the Senate where the Democratic Party,
which
had had a 60 vote majority, then only had
a 59 vote majority.
This meant that the passing bills in the
Senate could not longer occur
as easily because of the possibility that
bills and debate would be filibustered.
So the Seante and the House then passed
healthcare reform with the process now
known as reconciliation.
And one of the things that reconciliation
required was that
that original Senate bill which had even
before the Healthcare
reform, been the Senate or been the
Taxation for Service
Members Provision, was then the bill that
ultimately became Healthcare Reform.
So, in terms of analysis from the
origination cause, this is a
process that's known as creating a Shell
Bill or using a Shell Bill.
Where, a bill from the House of
Representative that has been passed by the
House
is completely amended so that the old text
is extricated and new text is put in.
So, from a procedural standpoint, the tie,
that bill, in this case HR3590,
technically originated in the House but
all of the contents of that bill came from
the Senate, and this is important because
the second half of the origination clause
States that the Senate may propose or
concur with amendments, as on other bills.
So, the constitutional structure is that,
The
House has to originate bills, that are for
raising revenue, but the Senate can amend
them just like it can any other bills.
So, what we see with shell bills is that
the
senate amends the bill essentially 100%
everything but the title.
Takes a way all of the texts and replaces
it with new texts of potentially a
completely different topic.
Now so that's one of the reason that the
Pacific Legal Foundation
has brought this suit, and one of the
sources for Greg's question.
But what interesting is that under Supreme
Court precedent, this
is relatively, it seems to be a relatively
OK procedure.
So shell bills have been used by by
different
administrations and different Congresses
over the past several decades,
including the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which
was an
incredibly important tax reform bill
passed under President Reagan.
Supreme Court precedents about the
origination
clause cover all sorts of territory.
In 1911 in a case called Flint
versus Stone Tracy Company, the Supreme
Court upheld
a bill where an inheritance tax was
replaced with the nation's first corporate
income tax.
That was again a situation where the House
passed one form of
revenue raising and the Senate changed
it complete, to be something completely
different.
The Supreme Court then said, well since
they both were raising revenue, they were
similar
enough that, the Senate's version was
still
germane and was allowed under the
originations clause.
In 1914 then, in a case Rainy vs The
United States, the Supreme
Court said that it wouldn't look into the
germaneness of, of duly passed bills.
It sort of placed a limit on its ability
to sort of interrogate the contents of
these bills.
If the Senate has amended a bill, no
matter how much
it's amended it, if that bill was then
passed by the House
and the Senate and sign by the President,
and is a dully
enrolled bill, the Supreme Court said it
would limit its germaneness inquiries.
So for those reasons it may be that the
affordable,
that this challenge, the Affordable Care
Act would fall under the
nor, that the procedural mechanism of a
shell bill would
be totally fine for the passage of the
Affordable Care Act.
There's also the fact that during
reconciliation,
the process by which the bill was
ultimately passed, the house did amend the
bill, and the house did pass it.
So the house's imprimatur is on the bill,
it's not as
if the senate is acting in some sort of
rogue capacity.
And finally there's the considerations
that were ruled upon in the trial court.
So this case is being heard by the DC
Circuit, a court of appeals
on May eighth which means that it's
already been heard by, by a trial court.
The trial court ruled under a different
set of Supreme Court precedents, that this
bill is actually not to be interpreted as
primarily a bill for raising a revenue.
Since the major purpose of the bill was
healthcare reform, it's an
incidental effect that the bill then will
tend to raise revenue by,
imposing fines or taxes on people who do
not, do not pursue health, health
insurance on the exchanges or through
their employer or elsewhere, elsewhere.
So, under the trial court's analysis and
under
Supreme Court precedent, bills whose
primary purpose is something
else and just have happen to raise revenue
as
an incidental effect actually can
originate in the Senate.
So those are two different mechanisms that
you could see to uphold
the constitutionality of the Affordable
Care
Act against an Originations Clause
challenge anyway.
One is that, because of this shell bill
mechanism, technically the, technically
the bill formally originated in the House,
and the Supreme Court has historically
been a little unwilling to determine
exactly what the limits are toward the
amendibility of the text of bills that do
originate in the House procedurally.
A second possibility is that even if the
bill, if even if
the courts INAUDIBLE] originate in the
Senate, because it's primary purpose is
something other than raising revenue, the
fact that it has an incidental
revenue raising function would mean that
the bill would still be constitutional.
But it's a very interesting question,
because
as you can tell, you know the shell
bill mechanism seems a little strange,
it's just
that the Supreme Court precedent over the
last
century or so has indicated an
unwillingness
by the courts to probe too far into
what is and is not allowable under
Congressional
procedure for the Senate to amend, amend
bills.
It's a very interesting question.
Next up we have a question by Paula Dryer,
who asks about the House Judiciary
Committee and holding a, a hearing in
December to consider the impeachment of
President Obama.
Paul asks what the founder's intent was
with the words
treason, bribery, and other high crimes
and misdemeanors, which are
the standards for which the House and the
Senate hold
impeachments, and, and convict the
President or other, other high officers.
Paul says that to me this seems to be a
political act.
A, a policy difference, and he, Paul
wonders
is this what the framers had in mind.
So, just to make sure we go over the, the
mechanisms under the Constitution.
Under the Constitution impeachment
provisions, the House indicts a
President or other high officer by a
majority vote.
But, two thirds of the Senate is then
needed to convict the President or other
officer
under The House's indictment, at which
point the
president for instance would be removed
from office.
So it requires bicameralism in some sense,
and a majority
vote in the house and 2/3 votes in the
senate.
So it's important to note that and there
was some
confusion of this in the comments that The
House Judiciary Committee
holding a hearing to consider the
impeachment is not the same
as the house impeaching the president,
it's very far from it.
But it's still an interesting questions as
to, as to what the original intent of the
founders was regarding impeachment, and
whether impeachment for
political differences was cognizable
under, under this original intention.
And interestingly enough the founders
actually
did inter, did seem to construe
impeachment
to be not just a criminal process, but
actually an actively a political process.
Early discussions in the federalist papers
and around the timing of the ratification
of the constitution show that high
misdemeanors,
this phrase in the constitution, could be
not just actions that are technically
criminal,
for instance, murder or bribery, but could
actually be other, other actions that are,
sort of, could be considered grievous
misconduct.
Things that the president should not be
doing,
even if, even if they're not technically
criminal.
Professor Amargo's into this a little bit,
in America's Constitution, A Biography.
What he writes on page 202, that America's
Constitution transformed
impeachment into a more precise
and proportionate system of political
punishment.
While the English high court of Parliament
claimed jurisdiction to impeach even
private citizens.
In America only federal officers would be
subject to impeachment.
America's impeachment tribunal would
itself be politically
accountable, structured to permit
judgements of state, of
statecraft to percolate into the process
and
thereby enhance the public legitimacy of
the verdict.
Professor Amar gives a contrast to the
system of impeachment in, under the
British monarchy
wherein Parliament would only impeach
Imperial Ministers, or
the, the King's Ministers, under a
criminal process.
So they would come up with criminal
sanctions possibly ginned up
or possibly accurate, and impose criminal
penalties, including the death penalty.
And so the the advantages of the political
process of impeachment are that by
separating it somewhat from this
quintessentially criminal
process, you allow the punishment to be
simply
removal from office, as opposed to these
criminal sanctions, and then allow
ordinary criminal courts
who have expertise in handling criminal
matters
to impose the actual punishments for
criminal behavior.
Of course there's you know, a potential
objection
to this consideration in that if
impeachment is
only supposed to be for high misdemeanors,
and
you make it this explicitly political
process, couldn't
you just have impeachment of a president
by
a Senator or a House who simply disagree
with the President's politics, don't like
the way
he or she is, is running the country.
And there're some clues in, in the
Constitution that suggest that such
low level political disagreement would not
be an appropriate excuse for impeachment.
First of all, you look at the overall
phrases in the Constitution which suggest
that impeachment is not just for high
misdemeanors, but also for treason or
bribery.
Now treason and bribery are pretty extreme
cases of misconduct
and they suggest a relatively high bar as
appropriate for mis,
for impeachment as just does the phrase
high crimes and
misdemeanors itself, the word high is
right there in the text.
Finally if you look at the fact that the
impeachment is a, is a tool,
is a bicameral process where both the
House
and the Senate have to concur, you see
that there's actually,uh, that's a
relatively high
bar to set for the removal of the
president from office, especially because
the actual conviction
in the senate is by a 2/3 majority.
So this suggests that, politically, while,
you know, it is feasible for the
congress, for congress to impeach the
president
simply because of political disagreement,
you'd really
need a truly national constituency that
viewed this, that viewed the president's
actions
as sufficient to warrant, impeachment and
that, that's a really high bar to set.
One of the most obvious examples of this
is, is Andrew Johnson's impeachment,
where in the the House did succeed in, in
indicting President Johnson, but
he was acquitted by the Senate, for any
actual conviction or misconduct, and
that's particularly noticeable because
President Johnson was
not popular in the Senate at all.
The Senate in fact that acquitted
President Johnson of impeachment, had
overridden President
Johnson's veto's, which also requires a
two
thirds majority it's a very high power.
15 out of 21 times that had the chance to.
This is a Senate that did not think that
it owed President Johnson any favors.
Yet, none the less, because of a high bar
set historically and in
the text of the constitution and
also procedurally by the constitution,
they're, it
seems unlikely that pure politics would be
able to override to remove a
president from office at least as we've
seen so far in constitutional history.
That's it for the questions that I wanted
to
answer but I also thought I would flag
another comment
and suggestion made by someone in the
forums which I
thought was very interesting, and that's
by Robert Harrison Lane.
Robert writes that Robert suggests the
possibility of a
constitutional amendment that would answer
questions of interpretive methodology.
You know in the forum as well as in the
law more generally.
There's been lots of conversation about
what tools of interpretation
we should use for the constitution, apart
from the text itself.
So, you know, history, original intent
ideas of more, more of a living
constitution mechanism, oh, or, other
rules like
the, the rule of lenity for, for
assuming that criminal, criminal
misconduct is or
criminal punishment is particularly harsh
and so
we should construe the Constitution in
favor
of less, less harshness in criminal
contexts.
So, Rob suggests that we could actually
have a
constitutional amendment, which would
resolve some of these issues.
Saying, which tools of interpretation we
should use
in interpreting the Constitution itself
after the text itself.
He also suggests that an amendment could
prioritize among different tools and say,
you know,
first courts should look to this, second
courts
should look to that, and third, the
following.
I thought this was a really interesting
idea.
So, I just wanted to, to bring it up to
everyone's attention just so you guys
know where, we, we think the conversations
that
are going on in the forums are very
interesting.
And I thought this was a particularly
interesting suggestion that I would
bring to Professor Amar's attention as
well, if he hasn't already seen it.
So, thanks Rob, and thanks for everyone
else who's been asking questions.
And we look forward to seeing you next
week.
